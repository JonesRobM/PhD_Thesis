    abstract = "{It is shown in this paper that the differential equations of macroscopic thermodynamics can be generalized in such a way that they apply as well to small (i.e., nonmacroscopic) systems. Conventional thermodynamic relations then follow from the present treatment as a limiting case (large system). As with macroscopic thermodynamics, there are two main classes of applications: (1) as an aid in analyzing, classifying, and correlating equilibrium experimental data on ``small systems'' such as (non‐interacting) colloid particles, liquid droplets, crystallites, macromolecules, polymers, polyelectrolytes, nucleic acids, proteins, etc.; and (2) to verify, stimulate, and provide a framework for statistical mechanical analysis of models of finite (i.e., ``small'') systems. A well‐known experimental and theoretical example (in which there are sizable effects of chain length) is the helix‐coil transition in synthetic polypeptides and polynucleotides. Unlike macroscopic thermodynamics, thermodynamic functions are different for different environments (open, closed, isothermal, siobaric, etc.). Although it is possible to derive a single set of thermodynamic equations applicable to all environments, it proves useful to give a separate analysis for each environment. Several cases are discussed, and a few simple statistical mechanical models are used for purposes of illustration. The partition function for a ``completely open'' small system can be used without any special technique such as is required when this partition function is applied to a macroscopic system. Solvent effects are discussed and details are given in one case. The present method provides an invariant treatment of the spherical interface of a drop or bubble, independent of any choice of dividing surface. Usually, only mean values of fluctuating extensive variables appear in thermodynamic equations. This is justified in macroscopic thermodynamics because fluctuations are generally unimportant. The situation is different for small systems and we derive, in one case, a hierarchy of thermodynamic equations involving higher moments of the probability distribution of fluctuating extensive properties.}",

ABSTRACT = {Nanothermodynamics extends standard thermodynamics to facilitate finite-size effects on the scale of nanometers. A key ingredient is Hill’s subdivision potential that accommodates the non-extensive energy of independent small systems, similar to how Gibbs’ chemical potential accommodates distinct particles. Nanothermodynamics is essential for characterizing the thermal equilibrium distribution of independently relaxing regions inside bulk samples, as is found for the primary response of most materials using various experimental techniques. The subdivision potential ensures strict adherence to the laws of thermodynamics: total energy is conserved by including an instantaneous contribution from the entropy of local configurations, and total entropy remains maximized by coupling to a thermal bath. A unique feature of nanothermodynamics is the completely-open nanocanonical ensemble. Another feature is that particles within each region become statistically indistinguishable, which avoids non-extensive entropy, and mimics quantum-mechanical behavior. Applied to mean-field theory, nanothermodynamics gives a heterogeneous distribution of regions that yields stretched-exponential relaxation and super-Arrhenius activation. Applied to Monte Carlo simulations, there is a nonlinear correction to Boltzmann’s factor that improves agreement between the Ising model and measured non-classical critical scaling in magnetic materials. Nanothermodynamics also provides a fundamental mechanism for the 1/f noise found in many materials.},

As Pt nanoparticles are normally used to maximize catalyst utilization and to minimize catalyst loading, it is important to rationalize and predict catalytic activity trends in nanoparticles in simple terms, while being able to compare these trends with those of extended surfaces. The trends in the adsorption energies of small oxygen- and hydrogen-containing adsorbates on Pt nanoparticles of various sizes and on extended surfaces were analyzed through DFT calculations by making use of the generalized coordination numbers of the surface sites. This simple and predictive descriptor links the geometric arrangement of a surface to its adsorption properties. It generates linear adsorption-energy trends, captures finite-size effects, and provides more accurate descriptions than d-band centers and usual coordination numbers. Unlike electronic-structure descriptors, which require knowledge of the densities of states, it is calculated manually. Finally, it was shown that an approximate equivalence exists between generalized coordination numbers and d-band centers. {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

To propose new defected catalytic surfaces, there is a need to systematically search through a combinatorial number of possible atom arrangements.

In this work, we develop several formulations for catalytic activity and stability as part of mathematical optimization models for designing nanostructured surfaces. Using the oxygen reduction reaction as an example, we show how optimization-based design can be used to efficiently explore the trade-off of activity against stability of surfaces. We furthermore demonstrate how nanostructuring can be applied to increase the expected activity of surfaces under various constraints on the coverage and overbinding of adsorbates. Our approach can be generally applied to other chemistries of interest and is suitably parameterized such that a wide array of systems can be considered, enabling evaluation of the sensitivity of different systems to constraints on the design space.},

Using molecular dynamics, we model formation pathways characteristic of physical synthesis routes as the annealing of a liquid droplet, the growth proceeding via the addition of single atoms, and the coalescence of individual nanoparticles. Each formation process leads to different and characteristic size-dependent distributions of their adsorption sites, catalogued and monitored on-the-fly by means of a suitable geometrical descriptor. Annealed or coalesced nanoparticles present a rather homogeneous distribution in the kind and relative abundance of non-equivalent adsorption sites. Atom-by-atom grown nanoparticles, instead, exhibit a more marked occurrence of adsorption sites corresponding to adatoms and small islands on (111) and (100) facets. Regardless of the formation process, highly coordinated sites are more likely in larger nanoparticles, while the abundance of low-coordination sites depends on the formation process and on the nanoparticle size. Furthermore, we show how each characteristic distribution of adsorption sites reflects in different size trends for the Cu-nanoparticle activity, taking as an example the electro-reduction of CO2 into CH4. To this end, we employ a multi-scale method and observe that the faceted but highly defected structures obtained during the atom-by-atom growth become more and more active with increasing size, with a mild dependence on the original seed.

abstract  ="Recent advances in experimental synthesis of nanostructures have shown that the interplay between nanoparticle shapes and sizes is crucial to achieve catalysts with high mass activity toward oxygen electroreduction. This is particularly important for proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs){,} in which expensive and scarce Pt electrocatalysts are used. In this work{,} we propose a theoretical approach for oxygen electroreduction on PEMFCs to identify not only the size of optimal nanoparticles{,} but also their shapes.

Furthermore{,} we examine nanostructure size effects to guide chemical routes for experimental synthesis of the identified electrocatalysts. Our fast theoretical evaluation of thousands of different nanostructures aids in the search for active catalysts{,} as substantially enhanced mass activities over commercial Pt/C are predicted for pure Pt electrocatalysts{,} thus unveiling great potential to reduce the Pt loading in PEMFCs."}

Here we investigate the OER activity of Au-Fe nanoalloys obtained by laser-ablation synthesis in solution. This method allows a high amount of iron (up to 11 at \%) to be incorporated into the gold lattice, which is not possible in Au-Fe alloys synthesized by other routes, due to thermodynamic constraints. The Au0.89Fe0.11 nanoalloys exhibit strongly enhanced OER in comparison to the individual pure metal nanoparticles, lowering the onset of OER and increasing up to 20 times the current density in alkaline aqueous solutions. Such a remarkable electrocatalytic activity is associated to nanoalloying, as demonstrated by comparative examples with physical mixtures of gold and iron nanoparticles. These results open attractive scenarios to the use of kinetically stable nanoalloys for catalysis and energy conversion.},

Herein, peptide Z1 is employed to fabricate a series of AuPt alloyed nanoparticles with different Au-to-Pt ratios. The morphology is examined by electron microscopic techniques, and well-defined peanut-shape is observed for Au33Pt67 while spherical particles are obtained for the other samples. The AuPt alloys demonstrate effective electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Au33Pt67 exhibits the best bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Its ORR activity is superior than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, verified by the positive onset potential (+1.02 V vs. RHE) and large diffusion limited current density, while its HER activity is comparable with Pt/C, evidenced by the small overpotential at 10 mA cm$^{-2}$ (-171 mV vs. RHE) and low Tafel slope. Moreover, Au33Pt67 exhibits markedly higher long-term durability than Pt/C for both ORR and HER. The excellent activity and stability for ORR and HER are ascribed to Au alloying Pt induced synergistic effects. The results highlight the advantages of using peptide to fabricate bi-functional or multiple functional electrocatalysts with desirable activity and robust stability.}

Here{,} we report a preliminary investigation employing time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) calculations to capture this process at a model metal-adsorbate interface formed by a silver nanoparticle (Ag147) and a carbon monoxide molecule (CO). Direct hot-electron transfer is observed to occur from the occupied states of Ag to the unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO.

abstract={Harnessing photoexcited ``hot'' carriers in metallic nanostructures could define a new phase of non-equilibrium optoelectronics for photodetection and photocatalysis. Surface plasmons are considered pivotal for enabling efficient operation of hot carrier devices. Clarifying the fundamental role of plasmon excitation is therefore critical for exploiting their full potential. Here, we measure the internal quantum efficiency in photoexcited gold (Au)--gallium nitride (GaN) Schottky diodes to elucidate and quantify the distinct roles of surface plasmon excitation, hot carrier transport, and carrier injection in device performance. We show that plasmon excitation does not influence the electronic processes occurring within the hot carrier device. Instead, the metal band structure and carrier transport processes dictate the observed hot carrier photocurrent distribution. The excellent agreement with parameter-free calculations indicates that photoexcited electrons generated in ultra-thin Au nanostructures impinge ballistically on the Au--GaN interface, suggesting the possibility for hot carrier collection without substantial energy losses via thermalization.}

However, the mechanisms behind plasmonic carrier generation remain poorly understood. Here we use nanowire-based hot-carrier devices on a wide-bandgap semiconductor to show that plasmonic carrier generation is proportional to internal field-intensity enhancement and occurs independently of bulk absorption. We also show that plasmon-induced hot electrons have higher energies than carriers generated by direct excitation and that reducing the barrier height allows for the collection of carriers from plasmons and direct photoexcitation. Our results provide a route to increasing the efficiency of plasmonic hot-carrier devices, which could lead to more efficient devices for converting sunlight into usable energy.},

Photo-thermal reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide into methane, methanol, and carbon monoxide under mild conditions over suitable (photo)catalysts is a feasible pathway for the production of fuels and platform chemicals with minimal involvement of fossil fuels. In this perspective, we showcase transition metal nanoparticles (Ni, Cu, and Ru) dispersed over oxide semiconductors and their ability to act as photo catalysts in reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), methane dry reforming, methanol synthesis, and Sabatier reactions. By using a combination of light and thermal energy for activation, reactions can be sustained at much lower temperatures compared to thermally driven reactions and light can be used to leverage reaction selectivity between methanol, methane, and CO. In addition to influencing the reaction mechanism and decreasing the apparent activation energies, accelerating reaction rates and boosting selectivity beyond thermodynamic limitations is possible. We also provide future directions for research to advance the current state of the art in photo-thermal CO2 conversion.}

abstract = {The ability to determine the atomic arrangement in nanoalloy catalysts and reveal the detailed structural features responsible for the catalytically active sites is essential for understanding the correlation between the atomic structure and catalytic properties, enabling the preparation of efficient nanoalloy catalysts by design. Herein we describe a study of CO oxidation over PdCu nanoalloy catalysts focusing on gaining insights into the correlation between the atomic structures and catalytic activity of nanoalloys. PdCu nanoalloys of different bimetallic compositions are synthesized as a model system and are activated by a controlled thermochemical treatment for assessing their catalytic activity. The results show that the catalytic synergy of Pd and Cu species evolves with both the bimetallic nanoalloy composition and temperature of the thermochemical treatment reaching a maximum at a Pd : Cu ratio close to 50 : 50. The nanoalloys are characterized structurally by ex situ and in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, including atomic pair distribution function analysis. The structural data show that, depending on the bimetallic composition and treatment temperature, PdCu nanoalloys adopt two different structure types. One features a chemically ordered, body centered cubic (B2) type alloy consisting of two interpenetrating simple cubic lattices, each occupied with Pd or Cu species alone, and the other structure type features a chemically disordered, face-centered cubic (fcc) type of alloy wherein Pd and Cu species are intermixed at random. The catalytic activity for CO oxidation is strongly influenced by the structural features. In particular, it is revealed that the prevalence of chemical disorder in nanoalloys with a Pd : Cu ratio close to 50 : 50 makes them superior catalysts for CO oxidation in comparison with the same nanoalloys of other bimetallic compositions. However, the catalytic synergy can be diminished if the Pd50Cu50 nanoalloys undergo phase segregation into distinct chemically-ordered (B2-type) and disordered (fcc-type) domains. This finding is significant since it provides a rational basis for streamlining the design and preparation of Pd-based nanoalloy catalysts in terms of atomic structure and phase state.},

abstract = {Abstract It is shown by an extensive benchmark on molecular energy data that the mathematical form of the damping function in DFT-D methods has only a minor impact on the quality of the results. For 12 different functionals, a standard “zero-damping” formula and rational damping to finite values for small interatomic distances according to Becke and Johnson (BJ-damping) has been tested. The same (DFT-D3) scheme for the computation of the dispersion coefficients is used. The BJ-damping requires one fit parameter more for each functional (three instead of two) but has the advantage of avoiding repulsive interatomic forces at shorter distances. With BJ-damping better results for nonbonded distances and more clear effects of intramolecular dispersion in four representative molecular structures are found. For the noncovalently-bonded structures in the S22 set, both schemes lead to very similar intermolecular distances. For noncovalent interaction energies BJ-damping performs slightly better but both variants can be recommended in general. The exception to this is Hartree-Fock that can be recommended only in the BJ-variant and which is then close to the accuracy of corrected GGAs for non-covalent interactions. According to the thermodynamic benchmarks BJ-damping is more accurate especially for medium-range electron correlation problems and only small and practically insignificant double-counting effects are observed. It seems to provide a physically correct short-range behavior of correlation/dispersion even with unmodified standard functionals. In any case, the differences between the two methods are much smaller than the overall dispersion effect and often also smaller than the influence of the underlying density functional. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract  ="We present the GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry{,} kinetics and noncovalent interactions. Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme J. Chem. Theory Comput.{,} 2011{,} 7{,} 291]{,} it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems—with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time—and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community via a dedicated website. Herein{,} we demonstrate the importance of better reference values{,} and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems{,} including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations{,} and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions{,} and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are{,} in particular{,} DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ){,} DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ){,} and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V{,} M052X-D3(0){,} and ωB97X-D3{,} but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level{,} the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ){,} B97-D3(BJ){,} and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods{,} such as B3LYP{,} are not part of our recommendations. In fact{,} with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community{'}s perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies."}

abstract = {We present the Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) method and its implementation in Quickstep which is part of the freely available program package CP2K. The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional, namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers.}

We first observe significant differences in the extinction spectra employing a classical approach based on the Green's dyadic method. By means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory, we calculate the optical spectrum under a δ-kick simulation, and the results are compared with the ground-state energetic properties, such as the HOMO-LUMO gap. A red-shift of the optical spectrum is expected as the fullerenes inflate, with only $\pm$ 10\% change in the size as the fullerene breathing, a 0.8 eV shift in the first peak position could be observed in the gold nanoparticle. Ag has a smoother behaviour than Au and Cu. We have also found changes in the optical spectra can not be directly interpreted as a result of changes in the HOMO-LUMO gap.}

The results of the addition of {Ag}, {Au}, and {Pd} up to a concentration of 2 mol\% on the structural, optical, morphological and antimicrobial properties was considered. X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the crystal structure of the host materials remained unaltered despite doping with noble metals. From the scanning electron microscopy results, it was evident that the doped nanoparticles aggregated in clusters of different sizes in the host matrix. The plasmonic effect was also observed in the absorbance spectra of the different doped materials. The obtained materials have shown promising antimicrobial features. All ZnO materials exhibited a high antimicrobial activity, with very low minimum inhibitory concentration values, against the planktonic growth of all tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. All doped materials exhibited very good anti-biofilm activity, the lowest minimal biofilm eradication concentration values being registered for ZnO doped with Au and Pd toward Escherichia coli and for ZnO doped with Ag against Candida albicans. These results indicate the potential that these materials have for antimicrobial applications in the fields of biomedicine and environmental protection.}

abstract  ="Doping metal nanoclusters with a second type of metal is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of nanoclusters at the atomic level and it also provides opportunities for a fundamental understanding of alloying rules as well as new applications. Herein{,} we have devised a new{,} one-phase strategy for achieving heavy Ag-doping in Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters. This strategy overcomes the light doping of silver by previous methods. X-ray crystallography together with ESI-MS determined the composition of the product to be [AgxAu25−x(SC6H11)18]− with x $\sim$ 21. Cryogenic optical spectroscopy (80-300 K) revealed fine features in optical absorption peaks. Interestingly, the heavy doping of silver does not significantly change the electron-phonon coupling strength and the surface phonon frequency. DFT simulations reproduced the experimentally observed trend of electronic structure evolution with Ag doping. We further investigated the electrocatalytic performance of such heavily Ag-doped nanoclusters for oxygen reduction in alkaline solutions. The mass activity of ligand-off [AgxAu25−x(SC6H11)18]− nanoclusters (217.4 A g−1metal) was determined to be higher than that of ligand-on nanoclusters (29.6 A g−1metal) at a potential of −0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) studies revealed the tunable kinetic features of the nanoclusters by ligand removal."}

In particular, we are concerned with the important case where Ĥ is the self-consistent Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian that stems from time-dependent functional theory. As the Kohn–Sham potential depends parametrically on the time-dependent density, Ĥ is in general time dependent, even in the absence of an external time-dependent field. The present analysis also holds for the description of the excited state dynamics of a many-electron system under the influence of arbitrary external time-dependent electromagnetic fields. Our discussion is separated in two parts: (i) First, we look at several algorithms to approximate exp(Â), where Â is a time-independent operator [e.g., Â=−iΔtĤ(τ) for some given time τ]. In particular, polynomial expansions, projection in Krylov subspaces, and split-operator methods are investigated. (ii) We then discuss different approximations for the time-evolution operator, such as the midpoint and implicit rules, and Magnus expansions. Split-operator techniques can also be modified to approximate the full time-dependent propagator. As the Hamiltonian is time dependent, problem (ii) is not equivalent to (i). All these techniques have been implemented and tested in our computer code OCTOPUS, but can be of general use in other frameworks and implementations.}",

Metal-metal interactions are modeled by a second-moment approximation tight-binding potential, while metal-oxide interactions are modeled by an analytic function fitted to first-principles calculations. Global optimization techniques are used to search for the most stable structural motifs at small sizes (N≤200), while at larger sizes different structural motifs are compared at geometric magic numbers for clusters up to several thousand atoms. Metals studied are Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt. They are grouped according to their mismatch to the oxide substrate (lattice constant of the metal versus oxygen-oxygen distance on the surface). Ag and Au, which have a smaller mismatch with MgO, are studied in Paper I, while Pd and Pt, with a larger mismatch, are investigated in Paper II. For Ag the cube-on-cube (001) epitaxy is favored in the whole size range studied, while for Au a transition from the (001) to the (111) epitaxy is located at N=1200. The reliability of the model is discussed in the light of the available experimental data.}",

abstract = {Kohn and Sham introduced orbitals into density–functional theory (DFT) as a set of physically meaningless auxiliary quantities useful only for calculating the total energy and charge density. While the traditional view is that Kohn–Sham orbitals do not approximate anything, Duffy et al. [Phys. Rev. A 50 (1994) 4707] showed that Kohn–Sham orbitals calculated using approximate exchange-correlation (xc) potentials could provide excellent approximations to spherically averaged momentum distributions, despite the fact that the corresponding Kohn–Sham orbital energies do not provide good approximations to ionization potentials when typical common present-day functionals are used. Since the original conclusions were based upon approximate xc potentials, the question arises as to how these conclusions might change when the same orbitals and orbital energies are calculated using an exact (or nearly exact) xc potential. For example, it has long been known that the highest occupied molecular orbital energy should give the exact ionization potential when the DFT xc functional is exact, but that this is not observed for approximate potentials. What about the other orbital energies? Long regarded as artifactual, we show that (1) Kohn–Sham orbital energies calculated using the exact Kohn–Sham exchange potential are actually better approximations to experimental ionization potentials than are Hartree–Fock orbital energies calculated via Koopmans’ theorem. We also show that (2) there are only negligable differences between spherically averaged momentum distributions calculated from HF orbitals and from Kohn–Sham orbitals calculated using the exact Kohn–Sham exchange potential, thus partially addressing the question of how the use of the exact Kohn–Sham potential will affect predictions for electron momentum spectroscopy. In addition to the two numbered observations above can be added that (3) it is quite remarkable that a nominally initial state theory such as DFT can do so well in describing ionization, a phenomenon which one expects to be sensitive to both initial and final states (before and after the ionization event).}

Die von Fock im Rahmen seiner Näherungsmethode zur Behandlung des quantenmechanischen Mehrelektronenproblems aufgestellten Gleichungen werden auf etwas allgemeinerer Grundlage diskutiert. Es wird angegeben, wie man in eindeutiger Weise den einzelnen Elektronen bestimmte Wellenfunktionen und Eigenwerte zuordnen kann. Diese Eigenfunktionen genügen einer Gleichung, die in einem etwas anderen Zusammenhang von Fock abgeleitet wurde. Die Eigenwerte sind bis auf kleinen Korrektionen den Ablösungsarbeiten der einzelnen Elektronen entgegengesetzt gleich. Das erreichte Ergebnis hat nur Bedeutung in denjenigen Fällen, wo der Ansatz einer einzigen Slaterschen Determinante für die Wellenfunktion sinnvoll ist.}

Dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt is significantly weakened in the aqueous phase compared to adsorption at gas-solid interfaces. Water destabilizes the adsorbed H atoms, decreasing the heat of adsorption by 19-22 kJ  while inducing an additional entropy loss of 50-70 J   K−1. Upon dissociative adsorption of H2, the average distance of water from the Pt surface increases and the liquid adopts a structure that is more ordered than before close to the Pt surface, which limits the translation mobility of the adsorbed H atoms. The presence of hydrated hydronium ions next to the Pt surface further lowers the H−Pt bond strength.},

We examine the extent to which a description of cage-breaking within the energy landscape is a description of long-term diffusion. This description includes the identification of cage-breaks that are reversed, and those that are productive towards long-term diffusion. At low temperatures, diffusion is adequately described by productive cage-breaks, or by considering all cage-breaks and accounting for the effect of reversals. To estimate the diffusion constant we require only the mean square displacement of a cage-break, the average waiting time for a cage-break, and a measure of the number of reversed cage-breaks. Cage-breaks can be visualized within the potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs, and we compare the use of productive cage-breaks with previous definitions of “megabasins” or “metabasins.”}",

Plasmon physics is intriguing and its precise modelling proved to be challenging. In fact, plasmons are highly responsive to a multitude of factors, either intrinsic to the Au NPs or from the environment, and recently the need emerged for the correction of standard electromagnetic approaches with quantum effects. Applications related to plasmon absorption and scattering in Au NPs are impressively numerous, ranging from sensing to photothermal effects to cell imaging. Also, plasmon-enhanced phenomena are highly interesting for multiple purposes, including, for instance, Raman spectroscopy of nearby analytes, catalysis, or sunlight energy conversion. In addition, plasmon excitation is involved in a series of advanced physical processes such as non-linear optics, optical trapping, magneto-plasmonics, and optical activity. Here, we provide the general overview of the field and the background for appropriate modelling of the physical phenomena. Then, we report on the current state of the art and most recent applications of plasmon resonance in Au NPs.}

    abstract = "{We apply a recently developed quasi-diabatic (QD) scheme to the symmetric quasi-classical (SQC) approach for accurate quantum dynamics propagation. By using the adiabatic states as the QD states during a short-time quantum dynamics propagation, the QD scheme allows for directly interfacing the diabatic SQC method with commonly used adiabatic electronic structure calculations, thus alleviating any non-trivial theoretical efforts to reformulate SQC in the adiabatic representation. Furthermore, the QD scheme ensures a stable propagation of the dynamics and allows using a much larger time step compared to directly propagating SQC dynamics in the adiabatic representation. This is due to the fact that the QD scheme does not explicitly require non-adiabatic couplings that could exhibit highly peaked values during non-adiabatic dynamics propagation. We perform the QD-SQC calculations with a wide range of model non-adiabatic systems to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme. This study opens up the possibility for combining accurate diabatic quantum dynamics methods such as SQC with any adiabatic electronic structure calculations for non-adiabatic on-the-fly propagations.}",

abstract = {A surface plasmon polariton (SPP) is an electromagnetic excitation existing on the surface of a good metal. It is an intrinsically two-dimensional excitation whose electromagnetic field decays exponentially with distance from the surface. In the past, it was possible to study only the (far-field) scattered light produced by the interaction of surface polaritons with surface features. Only with the development of scanning near-field optical microscopy did it become possible to measure the surface polariton field directly in close proximity to the surface where the SPP exists. Here we overview the near-field studies of surface polaritons on randomly rough and nanostructured surfaces, theoretical models of SPP interaction with surface features, and SPP applications in novel photonic technologies. Surface polariton scattering, interference, backscattering, and localization will be discussed, as well as concepts of surface polariton optics and polaritonic crystals. Surface polaritons are finding an ever increasing number of applications in traditional domains of surface characterization and sensors as well as in newly emerging nano-photonic and optoelectronic technologies.}

              subject due to the complexity of size, shape, composition, and
              chemical ordering. The genetic algorithm is a popular global
              optimization method that can efficiently search for the

              from three significant limitations: the efficiency and accuracy

              describe the construction of a neural network potential intended

              various sizes, shapes, and compositions. We further introduce a

abstract="The computational prediction of thermodynamically stable metal cluster structures has developed into a sophisticated and successful field of research. To this end, research groups have developed, combined and improved algorithms for the location of energetically low-lying structures of unitary and alloy clusters containing several metallic species. In this chapter, we review the methods by which global optimisation is performed on metallic alloy clusters, with a focus on binary nanoalloys, over a broad range of cluster sizes. Case studies are presented, in particular for noble metal and coinage metal nanoalloys. The optimisation of chemical ordering patterns is discussed, including several novel strategies for locating low-energy permutational isomers of fixed cluster geometries. More advanced simulation scenarios, such as ligand-passivated, and surface-deposited clusters have been developed in recent years, in order to bridge the gap between isolated, bare clusters, and the situation observed under experimental conditions. We summarise these developments and consider the developments necessary to improve binary cluster global optimisation in the near future.",

The method appears to be more efficient than matrix or Green's function methods for large clusters modeled with realistic ionic pseudopotentials. As applications of the method, we exhibit results for sodium and lithium clusters and for (Formula presented) molecules. The calculated Mie resonance in (Formula presented) is practically identical to that obtained in the jellium approximation, leaving the origin of the redshift unresolved. The pseudopotential effects are strong in lithium and act to broaden the Mie resonance and give it a substantial redshift, confirming earlier studies. There is also a large broadening due to Landau damping in the calculated (Formula presented) response, again confirming earlier studies. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here - a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It can also be used to identify atoms in particular environment, such as FCC, HCP, BCC or icosahedral. We describe an application of this program to a study of crystal nucleation in a molten Cu slab. While the majority of atoms in the resulting crystals are classified as being FCC, stacking faults are observed and can be traced back to the near-critical nuclei. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Honeycutt1987,
abstract = {The properties of small clusters of Lennard-Jones atoms were studied by using molecular dynamics simulations. Clusters containing from 13 to 147 atoms were found to undergo a transition, analogous to a melting transition for bulk materials, from a low-energy solidlike structure at low temperatures to a set of higher energy liquidlike structures at high temperatures. The transition creates noticeable features in plots of the equilibrium energy of clusters as a function of temperature, but the shapes of the curves depend on the size of the cluster and on whether a canonical ensemble or microcanonical ensemble is used for calculating the properties. The nonequilibrium energy as a function of temperature on heating or cooling at a finite rate can differ significantly from the equilibrium results. Coexistence among the minimum-energy structure, high-energy liquidlike structures, and typically one or more intermediate structures was observed over a range of temperatures. Results from potential energy minimization of fcc and icosahedral structures of various sizes indicate that a Lennard-Jones cluster must contain at least 5000 atoms before the fcc structure becomes more stable than the structure of the Mackay icosahedra. {\textcopyright} 1987 American Chemical Society.},

Adsorbate vibrational excitations are selective to adsorbate/surface interactions and infrared (IR) spectra associated with activating adsorbate vibrational modes are accurate, capture details of most modes, and can be obtained operando. Current interpretation depends on heuristic peak assignments for simple spectra, precluding the possibility of obtaining detailed structural information. Here, we combine data-based approaches with chemistry-dependent problem formulation to develop physics-driven surrogate models that generate synthetic IR spectra from first-principles calculations. Using synthetic IR spectra of carbon monoxide on platinum, we implement multinomial regression via neural network ensembles to learn probability distributions functions (pdfs) that describe adsorption sites and quantify uncertainty. We use these pdfs to infer detailed surface microstructure from experimental spectra and extend this methodology to other systems as a first step towards characterizing complex interfaces and closing the materials gap.},

We use them to investigate the thermodynamic stability of gold nanoparticles of different sizes (1 to 6 nm), containing up to 6266 atoms, concerning a solid-liquid phase change through molecular dynamics simulations. We predict nanoparticle melting temperatures in good agreement with available experimental data. Furthermore, we characterize the solid-liquid phase change mechanism employing an unsupervised learning scheme to categorize local atomic environments. We thus provide a data-driven definition of liquid atomic arrangements in the inner and surface regions of a nanoparticle and employ it to show that melting initiates at the outer layers.},

Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great benefits could follow instead from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. We illustrate here our paradigm sustaining such vision, based around the four pillars of Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing. We then discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net), that has been tuned first to the demands of computational materials science. AiiDA's design is based on directed acyclic graphs to track the provenance of data and calculations, and ensure preservation and searchability. Remote computational resources are managed transparently, and automation is coupled with data storage to ensure reproducibility. Last, complex sequences of calculations can be encoded into scientific workflows. We believe that AiiDA's design and its sharing capabilities will encourage the creation of social ecosystems to disseminate codes, data, and scientific workflows.},

@misc{Ghiringhelli2017,
abstract = {With big-data driven materials research, the new paradigm of materials science, sharing and wide accessibility of data are becoming crucial aspects. Obviously, a prerequisite for data exchange and big-data analytics is standardization, which means using consistent and unique conventions for, e.g., units, zero base lines, and file formats. There are two main strategies to achieve this goal. One accepts the heterogeneous nature of the community, which comprises scientists from physics, chemistry, bio-physics, and materials science, by complying with the diverse ecosystem of computer codes and thus develops "converters" for the input and output files of all important codes. These converters then translate the data of each code into a standardized, code-independent format. The other strategy is to provide standardized open libraries that code developers can adopt for shaping their inputs, outputs, and restart files, directly into the same code-independent format. In this perspective paper, we present both strategies and argue that they can and should be regarded as complementary, if not even synergetic. The represented appropriate format and conventions were agreed upon by two teams, the Electronic Structure Library (ESL) of the European Center for Atomic and Molecular Computations (CECAM) and the NOvel MAterials Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory, a European Centre of Excellence (CoE). A key element of this work is the definition of hierarchical metadata describing state-of-the-art electronic-structure calculations.},

Numerical results are presented for a 256-atom supercell representation of a binary Lennard-Jones system. We then derive analytical formulae for the number of stationary points as a function of both system size and the Hessian index, using a framework based upon weakly interacting subsystems. This analysis reveals a simple relation between the total number of stationary points, the number of local minima, and the number of transition states connected on average to each minimum. Finally we calculate two measures of localization for the displacements corresponding to Hessian eigenvectors in samples of stationary points obtained from the Newton–Raphson-based geometry optimization scheme. Systematic differences are found between the properties of eigenvectors corresponding to positive and negative Hessian eigenvalues, and localized character is most pronounced for stationary points with low values of the Hessian index.}",

Comparison with the results reported in the literature indicates that the present method is highly efficient and a number of new putative global minima missed in the previous papers are found.

In this study{,} we uncover that even a simple tetrahedral nanoparticle supports rich spectral features due to symmetry breaking. This discovery runs counter to the reported gold tetrahedral nanoparticles{,} where only a single extinction peak was observed. We find that{,} in the case of a tetrahedral nanoparticle{,} the plasmonic quadrupole vertex mode becomes a bright mode and hybridizes with the dipole vertex mode{,} which splits the extinction peak and contributes to spectral diversity and tunability. The peak splitting is also found to be sensitively dependent on the roundness of vertices and edges. Furthermore{,} the tetrahedral depolarization factors are determined using the previously generalized absorption coefficient. We envision that this work will not only help fill the gap in understanding the optical properties enriched by symmetry breaking but also guide the superior probe design by combining spectral tunability with geometric simplicity of the nanoparticle."}

For a wide range of excited-state phenomena such as radiationless decay{,} energy and charge transfer{,} and photochemical reactions{,} the BO approximation breaks down due to strong couplings between two or more BO PESs. Non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is the method of choice to model these processes. We review new developments in quantum–classical dynamics{,} analytical derivative methods{,} and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) which have lead to a dramatic expansion of the scope of ab initio NAMD simulations for molecular systems in recent years. We focus on atom-centered Gaussian basis sets allowing highly efficient simulations for molecules and clusters{,} especially in conjunction with hybrid density functionals. Using analytical derivative techniques{,} forces and derivative couplings can be obtained with machine precision in a given basis set{,} which is crucial for accurate and stable dynamics. We illustrate the performance of surface-hopping TDDFT for photochemical reactions of the lowest singlet excited states of cyclohexadiene{,} several vitamin D derivatives{,} and a bicyclic cyclobutene. With few exceptions{,} the calculated quantum yields and excited state lifetimes agree qualitatively with experiment. For systems with ∼50 atoms{,} the present Turbomole implementation allows NAMD simulations with 0.2–0.4 ns total simulation time using hybrid density functionals and polarized double zeta valence basis sets on medium-size compute clusters.

    abstract = "{First-order nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements (NACMEs) are key for phenomena such as nonradiative transitions and excited-state decay, yet a consistent and practical first principles treatment has been elusive for molecules with more than a few heavy atoms. Here we present theory, implementation using Gaussian basis sets, and benchmarks of first-order NACMEs between ground and excited states in the framework of time-dependent hybrid density functional theory (TDDFT). A time-dependent response approach to NACMEs which avoids explicit computation of excited-state wave functions is outlined. In contrast to previous approaches, the present treatment produces exact analytical derivative couplings between time-dependent Kohn–Sham (TDKS) determinants in a finite atom-centered basis set. As in analytical gradient theory, derivative molecular orbital coefficients can be eliminated, making the computational cost independent of the number of nuclear degrees of freedom. Our expression reduces to the exact Chernyak–Mukamel formula for first-order NACMEs in the complete basis-set limit, but greatly improves basis-set convergence in finite atom-centered basis sets due to additional Pulay type terms. The Chernyak–Mukamel formula is shown to be equivalent to the Hellmann–Feynman contribution in analytical gradient theory. Our formalism may be implemented in TDDFT analytical excited-state gradient codes with minor modifications. Tests for systems with up to 147 atoms show that evaluation of first-order NACMEs causes total computation times to increase by an insignificant 10\% on average. The resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the Coulomb energy (RI-J) reduces the computational cost by an order of magnitude for nonhybrid functionals, while errors are insignificant with standard auxiliary basis sets. We compare the computed NACMEs to full configuration interaction (FCI) in benchmark results for diatomic molecules; hybrid TDDFT and FCI are found to be in agreement for regions of the potential energy curve where the Kohn–Sham ground-state reference is stable and the character of the excitation is properly captured by the present functionals. With these developments, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations of molecular systems in the 100 atoms regime are within reach.}",

By exploiting analogies to ground state energy and gradient calculations, efficient techniques can be transferred to excited state methods. Benchmark results demonstrate that, for low-lying excited states, geometry optimizations are not substantially more expensive than for the ground state, independent of the molecular size. We assess the quality of calculated adiabatic excitation energies, structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies by comparison with accurate experimental data for a variety of excited states and molecules. Similar trends are observed for adiabatic excitation energies as for vertical ones. TDDFT is more robust than CIS and TDHF, in particular, for geometries differing significantly from the ground state minimum. The TDDFT excited state structures, dipole moments, and vibrational frequencies are of a remarkably high quality, which is comparable to that obtained in ground state density functional calculations. Thus, yielding considerably more accurate results at similar computational cost, TDDFT rivals CIS as a standard method for calculating excited state properties in larger molecules.}",

The hopping rate is determined by the dynamics of the electronic bath (which are treated implicitly). For the case of one electronic bath, in the limit of small coupling to the bath, SH recovers phonon relaxation to thermal equilibrium and yields the correct impurity electron population (as compared with numerical renormalization group). For the case of out of equilibrium dynamics, SH current-voltage (I-V) curve is compared with the quantum master equation (QME) over a range of parameters, spanning the quantum region to the classical region. In the limit of large temperature, SH and QME agree. Furthermore, we can show that, in the limit of low temperature, the QME agrees with real-time path integral calculations.

The results show that during the first 50 fs after a vertical photoexcitation to the ππ* state, the nonadiabatic coupling between the S1 and the S2 states produces a recurrence pattern of oscillation of the populations in these states. Within the first 100 fs, the S1 state population spans a limited region of the configuration space between the initial geometries and the twisted-pyramidalized minimum on the crossing seam (MXS). Depending on the way of counting, about 50\% of the S1→S0 transitions occur in the pyramidalized region of the crossing seam, but not necessarily close to the MXS. The remaining 50\% occurs in the H-migration and ethylidene regions. Our analysis shows that the ethylidene region becomes more important in later stages of the dynamics when the flux of trajectories that was not effectively converted to the ground state in the pyramidalized region starts to reach this part of the configuration space.

    abstract = "{A method is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of processes that involve electronic transitions. The time dependent electronic Schrödinger equation is solved self‐consistently with the classical mechanical equations of motion of the atoms. At each integration time step a decision is made whether to switch electronic states, according to probabilistic ‘‘fewest switches’’ algorithm. If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy. The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations for three one‐dimensional, two‐state models, two of which have been specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical–quantal dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial indications are encouraging. The model should be applicable to a wide variety of gas‐phase and condensed‐phase phenomena occurring even down to thermal energies.}",

The zeroth‐order term (in the nonadiabatic coupling) for the propagator is just the well‐known single surface adiabatic propagator. The first‐order terms involve single hops from the initial adiabatic state to other states. Energy is conserved in these hops and the momentum change accompanying each hop occurs in the direction parallel to the nonadiabatic coupling for the transition. Both transmitted and reflected contributions are included after a hop. The propagator expression has the zeroth‐order (single surface) semiclassical form before and after the hop. The complete propagator includes terms with any number of hops and all possible hopping points. These multihop terms are defined analogously to the first‐order (single hop) terms. An alternative formulation of the semiclassical propagator, which includes contributions from a broader range of hopping trajectories, is also developed.}",

The purpose of this overall approach is to be able to represent the electronic states in electronically nonadiabatic collision processes by a classical degree of freedom so that all degrees of freedom, electronic and heavy particle (i.e., translation, rotation, and vibration) can be treated on a consistent dynamical footing. Application of this model to the quenching of F* (2P1/2) by collisions with H2 is described, and this completely classical approach is seen to give excellent agreement with the quantum mechanical coupled channel calculations of Rebentrost and Lester.}",

abstract = {Metadynamics is a powerful algorithm that can be used both for reconstructing the free energy and for accelerating rare events in systems described by complex Hamiltonians, at the classical or at the quantum level. In the algorithm the normal evolution of the system is biased by a history-dependent potential constructed as a sum of Gaussians centered along the trajectory followed by a suitably chosen set of collective variables. The sum of Gaussians is exploited for reconstructing iteratively an estimator of the free energy and forcing the system to escape from local minima. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, with a focus on the practical aspects that need to be addressed when one attempts to apply metadynamics to a new system: (i) the choice of the appropriate set of collective variables; (ii) the optimal choice of the metadynamics parameters and (iii) how to control the error and ensure convergence of the algorithm.}

    abstract = { Atomistic simulations play a central role in many fields of science. However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics. }

abstract = {Abstract Metadynamics is a powerful technique for enhancing sampling in molecular dynamics simulations and reconstructing the free-energy surface as a function of few selected degrees of freedom, often referred to as collective variables (CVs). In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applications in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies to alleviate this difficulty. Later in the second part, we present a few recent representative applications, which we have classified into three main classes: solid-state physics, chemical reactions, and biomolecules. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

Small-world character is present{,} but statistical tests show that a power law is not a good fit{,} so the networks are not scale-free. These results for clusters are compared with the corresponding properties for the molecular and atomic structural glass formers ortho-terphenyl and binary Lennard-Jones.

    abstract = { Recent advances in the potential energy landscapes approach are highlighted, including both theoretical and computational contributions. Treating the high dimensionality of molecular and condensed matter systems of contemporary interest is important for understanding how emergent properties are encoded in the landscape and for calculating these properties while faithfully representing barriers between different morphologies. The pathways characterized in full dimensionality, which are used to construct kinetic transition networks, may prove useful in guiding such calculations. The energy landscape perspective has also produced new procedures for structure prediction and analysis of thermodynamic properties. Basin-hopping global optimization, with alternative acceptance criteria and generalizations to multiple metric spaces, has been used to treat systems ranging from biomolecules to nanoalloy clusters and condensed matter. This review also illustrates how all this methodology, developed in the context of chemical physics, can be transferred to landscapes defined by cost functions associated with machine learning. }

The global minima of the two systems are also located using the CHARMM22 force field of Mackerell et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B 102, 3586 (1998)], for comparison with AMBER95.}",

abstract  ="Previous work has indicated that in calculating rates using activated-complex theory one should omit symmetry numbers from the rotational partition functions and multiply by a statistical factor; this factor is the number of equivalent forms of the activated complex that can arise from the reactants. This procedure can lead to error if the activated complex is chosen to have such a high degree of symmetry that it can form more than one form of the reactants or products. It is shown from a consideration of multi-dimensional potential-energy surfaces that a single activated complex cannot exist at the intersection of two valleys; three valleys{,} for example{,} will give rise to three separate activated states{,} each of which represents the lowest pass between a pair of valleys. The implications of this conclusion are considered with reference to several reactions{,} including that between hydrogen and iodine."}

abstract = {Approximate free energy surfaces and transition rates are presented for alanine dipeptide for a variety of force fields and implicit solvent models. Our calculations are based upon local minima, transition states and pathways characterised for each potential energy surface using geometry optimisation. The superposition approach employing only local minima and harmonic densities of states provides a representation of low-lying regions of the free energy surfaces. However, including contributions from the transition states of the potential energy surface and selected points obtained from displacements along the corresponding reaction vectors produces surfaces that compare quite well with results from replica exchange molecular dynamics. Characterising the local minima, transition states, normal modes, pathways, rate constants and free energy surfaces for each force field within this framework typically requires between one and five minutes cpu time on a single processor.}

In segregating systems with small lattice mismatch{,} we find that homotops have a relatively straightforward landscape with few local optima – a scenario well-suited for local (combinatorial) optimisation techniques that scale quadratically with system size. Combining these techniques with multiple local-neighbourhood structures yields a search for multiminima{,} and we demonstrate that generalised basin-hopping with a metropolis acceptance criterion in the space of multiminima can then be effective for global optimisation of binary and ternary nanoalloys."}

The non-local dielectric function is derived for the effective potential – the poles of the potential give the localized surface and bulk plasmon excitation energies. The excitation energies can be analytically calculated for a metal nano-sphere and a nano-shell when the electron density is assumed to have a step function shape at surfaces. The energies agree with those calculated using semi-classical methods. Terms for coupling between the localized surface and bulk plasmons appear in the effective potential. The local dielectric function is, however, derived for the electric field, which has the well-known formula: 1 - ω p 2 ( r )/ω 2 , where ω p ( r ) is the position dependent bulk plasmon frequency. }

Here{,} we report on investigations of hot electron generation and extraction from Pt decorated SiO2-Au nanoparticles using the degradation of methylene blue dye as a test-bed. Enhanced catalytic activity was found with an increase of Pt loading on the surface of the heterostructures. The small size of the Au nanoparticles ($\sim$ 12 nm) decorating the silica nanoparticles reduces hot electron collisions and related thermalization processes{,} since charge carriers have short paths to the surface where reactions take place and where Pt is situated. The heterostructures exhibit a broad plasmonic resonance in the visible wavelength range from 500 to 700 nm and hot carrier generation predominately takes place under resonant excitation. Electron-microscopy characterization and numerical modelling have allowed the optimization of Pt coverage for hot-electron transfer{,} consisting of a thin Pt shell covering the Au nanoparticle with Pt nanoparticles additionally placed on top. This geometry provides an increased number of active sites for methylene blue degradation and promotes separation of charge carriers generated by plasmonic excitations in Au. Such SiO2-Au-Pt nanoparticles are attractive for hot-electron production due to the tunability of their plasmonic resonance and enhanced catalytic activity."}

Supported gold catalysts were originally identified as being active for this reaction twenty years ago, and since then, considerable advances have been made in the synthesis and characterisation of these catalysts. In this review, we identify and evaluate the progress towards solving the most important challenge in this research area: the development of robust, highly active catalysts that do not deactivate on-stream under realistic reaction conditions.}

Nanorod particles with a diameter size of around 10 nm and a length of around 20 nm were successfully synthesized. These nanoparticles were then attached to the BDD surface by using allylamine as the bridge. Comparison among the BDD modified with Cu@Au and individual gold nanoparticles showed that Cu@Au nanoparticles created around 3 times higher gold coverage on the BDD surface than normal gold nanoparticles. It was also found that the use of allylamine as the bridge can attach more gold than copper nanoparticles. Moreover{,} around two times higher current responses of oxygen reduction reaction were observed at Cu@Au-modified BDD. Good linearity in a concentration range from 2 to 9 ppm could be achieved with a sensitivity of 0.0138 mA ppm−1 and limit detection of 1.98 ppm. An application of the modified BDD for a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) sensor using Rhodotorula mucilaginosa UICC Y-181 as the biosensing agent was also demonstrated with glucose solutions as the solution model. Sensitivity equivalent to 17.4 μA mM−1 BOD could be achieved. The system showed good stability with an RSD of 3.45\% in 10 measurements."}

abstract = {Propene oxidation to propene oxide (PO) was performed with N2O in the temperature range of 473-673 K using TiO2-supported Au and Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles synthesized from pre-formed thiol-capped nanoparticles of controlled composition and size. Catalysts were activated by calcination at different temperatures in the range 573-873 K and characterized by HRTEM, XPS, and TPR. Among a series of catalysts with different Au/Cu ratio and metal loading, the Au1Cu3/TiO2 with 1.2 wt\% exhibited the best catalytic performance for epoxidation, both in terms of propene conversion rate and selectivity towards PO (0.25 mol POgM−1h−1 at 573 K). The highest TOF was obtained over a catalyst calcined at 673 K. At this calcination temperature, HRTEM revealed a large perimeter interface between the nanoparticles and the support, which was accompanied by an intense TPR hydrogen uptake at low temperature. At increasing calcination temperature, the surface of Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles was progressively decorated with oxidized Cu species, which were detrimental for epoxidation and favored allylic oxidation products. Isolation effects and control of the extent of Cu oxidation by Au in the alloy nanoparticles as well as the perimeter interface between Au-Cu alloy nanoparticles and TiO2 are imagined to play pivotal roles in the epoxidation of propene.}

Detail study on the Au-Cu/TiO2-Fe2O3 catalysts was performed to optimize Ti/Fe ratio, pH during preparation of the catalyst, calcination temperature and reaction temperature. The Au-Cu/TiO2-Fe2O3 catalyst with Ti/Fe=9/1 atomic ratio is more active and exhibits higher methanol conversion compared to the Au-Cu/TiO2 catalyst. The higher activity of Fe-containing catalyst was attributed to the ability to supply reactive oxygen, thereby stabilize active gold species (Auδ+) in the catalyst. Studies on the optimization of pH during preparation of the Au-Cu/TiO2-Fe2O3 catalyst and calcination temperature showed that the catalyst prepared at pH 7 and dried at 373K (uncalcined) exhibited higher activity. The catalytic performance at various reaction temperatures shows that both methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity are increased with increasing the temperature. A small increase in CO selectivity was observed beyond 523K, which is due to the decomposition of methanol and reverse water gas shift at high temperatures.}

Partial densification and the resulting high porosity content of Al2O3 substrates sintered at low temperatures led to braze infiltration of Al2O3 pores in 20min contact but no penetration occurred in dense Al2O3 substrates sintered at high temperatures. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) examination of the joints showed that chemical reactions between Al2O3 and braze constituents formed a Ti-rich reaction layer at braze/Al2O3 interface regardless of the sintering conditions and degree of densification of the Al2O3. Some redistribution of the substrate and braze constituents across the joint interfaces was observed due to dissolution and interdiffusion. The Knoop microhardness of sintered alumina was consistent with the degree of Al2O3 densification achieved, and microhardness profiles across the joint regions displayed a minimum ($\sim$ 70-160KHN) in the braze region and a maximum (1900-2012KHN) in the alumina region. The polished CVI C-SiC composites led to better quality Al2O3/C-SiC composite joints and greater segregation of Ti at the composite/braze interface than unpolished composite specimens.}

The thermodynamic and kinetic origins of this phase selection are explored. The enthalpy of formation of both solutions has been determined as a function of composition using calorimetry measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The enthalpy of the fcc solution is found to be lower than that of the competing amorphous phase. The preference for the fcc crystalline state is enhanced by the low kinetic barrier to crystallization of the amorphous solution, which occurred during quenching even when high cooling rates were employed or during annealing at low temperatures. Consequently, the retention of an amorphous Ag-Cu solution required kinetic trapping using ultrahigh quenching rates achievable only under stringent vapor deposition conditions or in MD simulations. However, transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of local regions of amorphous Ag-Cu after cold rolling of multilayers of elemental Ag and Cu foils at room temperature. This result of partial amorphization demonstrates the possibility of mechanically driven solid-state amorphization in a system with a positive heat of mixing.}

abstract={Since Haruta et al. discovered that small gold nanoparticles finely dispersed on certain metal oxide supports can exhibit surprisingly high activity in CO oxidation below room temperature, heterogeneous catalysis by supported gold nanoparticles has attracted tremendous attention. The majority of publications deal with the preparation and characterization of conventional gold catalysts (e.g., Au/TiO2), the use of gold catalysts in various catalytic reactions, as well as elucidation of the nature of the active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this overview, we highlight the development of novel supported gold catalysts from a materials perspective. Examples, mostly from those reported by our group, are given concerning the development of simple gold catalysts with single metal-support interfaces and heterostructured gold catalysts with complicated interfacial structures. Catalysts in the first category include active Au/SiO2 and Au/metal phosphate catalysts, and those in the second category include catalysts prepared by pre-modification of supports before loading gold, by post-modification of supported gold catalysts, or by simultaneous dispersion of gold and an inorganic component onto a support. CO oxidation has generally been employed as a probe reaction to screen the activities of these catalysts. These novel gold catalysts not only provide possibilities for applied catalysis, but also furnish grounds for fundamental research.}

In this study, we investigated the etching mechanism of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by iodine on a single-nanoparticle level because AuNPs have become important nanoprobes with applications in sensing and bioimaging fields owing to their specific localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties. By using a scattered-light dark-field microscopic imaging (iDFM) technique, the in situ KI/I2-treated etching processes of various shapes of AuNPs, including nanospheres (AuNSs), nanorods (AuNRs), and nanotrigonal prisms (AuNTs), were monitored in real time. It was found that the scattered light of the different shapes of AuNPs exhibited noticeable color changes upon exposure to the etching solution. The scattering spectra during the etching process showed obvious blue-shifts with decreasing scattered intensity owing to the oxidation of Au atoms into [AuI2]--. Both finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and monitoring of morphological variations proved that the etching was a thermodynamic-dependent process through a chamfering mechanism coupled with layer-by-layer peeling, resulting in isotropic spheres with decreased particle sizes.},

Here, we demonstrate that 14{\thinspace}fs optical pulses in the near-infrared can drive electronic on-chip circuits with a prospective bandwidth up to 10{\thinspace}THz. The corresponding electronic pulses propagate in macroscopic striplines on a millimeter scale. We exploit femtosecond photoswitches based on asymmetric, nanoscale metal junctions to drive the pulses. The non-linear ultrafast response is based on a plasmonically enhanced, multiphoton absorption resulting in a field emission of ballistic hot electrons propagating across the nanoscale junctions. Our results pave the way towards femtosecond electronics integrated in wafer-scale THz circuits.},}

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, we provide evidence for visible light irradiation of the Au/TiO2 nanoparticles&rsquo; surface plasmon resonance band (SPR) leading to electron injection from the Au nanoparticles to the conduction band of TiO2. The Au/TiO2 SPR band is shown to greatly enhance the light absorption of TiO2 in the visible region. Evidence is presented for the light absorption by the Au/TiO2 plasmon bands leading to the dissolution of Au nanoparticles. This dissolution occurs concomitantly with the injection of the hot electrons generated by the Au plasmon into the conduction band of TiO2. The electron injection from the Au nanoparticles into TiO2 was followed by femtosecond spectroscopy. The formation of Au ions was further confirmed by the spectral shift of the transient absorption spectra of Au/TiO2. The spectral changes of the SPR band of Au/TiO2 nanoparticles induced by visible light were detected by spectrophotometer, and the morphological transformation of Au/TiO2 was revealed by electron microscopy techniques as well. Subsequently, the fate of the Au ions was sorted out during the growth and biofilm formation for some selected Gram-negative bacteria. This study compares the bactericidal mechanism of Au ions and Ag ions, which were found to be substantially different depending on the selected cell used as a probe.}

abstract  ="Technological and scientific challenges coupled with environmental considerations have attracted a search for robust{,} green and energy-efficient synthesis and processing routes for advanced functional nanomaterials. In this article{,} we demonstrate a high-energy ball milling technique for large-scale synthesis of nitrogen doped carbon nanoparticles{,} which can be used as an electro-catalyst for oxygen reduction reactions after a structural refinement with controlled thermal annealing. The resulting carbon nanoparticles exhibited competitive catalytic activity (5.2 mA cm$^{-2}$ kinetic-limiting current density compared with 7.6 mA cm$^{-2}$ on Pt/C reference) and excellent methanol tolerance compared to a commercial Pt/C catalyst. The proposed synthesis route by ball milling and annealing is an effective process for carbon nanoparticle production and efficient nitrogen doping{,} providing a large-scale production method for the development of highly efficient and practical electrocatalysts."}

abstract = {Hot carrier dynamics in plasmonic nanorod metamaterials and its influence on the metamaterial's optical Kerr nonlinearity is studied. The electron temperature distribution induced by an optical pump in the metallic component of the plasmonic metamaterial leads to geometry-dependent variations of the optical response and its dynamics as observed in both the transmission and reflection properties of the metamaterial slab. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of a metamaterial's optical response can be controlled via modal engineering. Both the transient response relaxation time and magnitude of the nonlinearity are shown to depend on the modal-induced spatial profile of the electron temperature distribution and the hot-electron diffusion in nanorods. The nonlocal effects, depending on the excitation-induced losses in the metal, are shown to dictate the modal structure of the metamaterial slab and the associated dynamics of its nonlinear response. The opportunity of controlling the electron temperature profile induced in the plasmonic nanorods by changing the metamaterial's geometry and/or excitation conditions paves the way to achieve controllable dynamics of the nonlinear optical response for free-space as well as integrated nanophotonic applications involving nonequilibrium electrons.},

Here, a density functional theory-based study on such NP models with different sizes and shapes reveals that the observed enhanced stability of Cu@Pt compared with Pt@Cu NPs is due to energetic reasons. On both types of core@shell NPs, charge is transferred from Cu to Pt, strengthening the NP cohesion energy in Pt@Cu NPs, and spreading charge along the surface in Cu@Pt NPs. The negative surface Pt atoms in the latter diminish the NO bonding owing to an energetic rise of the Pt bands, as detected by the appliance of the d-band model, although other factors, such as atomic low coordination or the presence of an immediate subsurface Pt atom do as well. A charge density difference analysis discloses a donation/back-donation mechanism in the NO adsorption.},

abstract={While free electrons in metals respond to ultrafast excitation with refractive index changes on femtosecond time scales, typical relaxation mechanisms occur over several picoseconds, governed by electron-phonon energy exchange rates. Here, we propose tailoring these intrinsic rates by engineering a non-uniform electron temperature distribution through nanostructuring, thus, introducing an additional electron temperature relaxation channel. We experimentally demonstrate a sub-300 fs switching time due to the wavelength dependence of the induced hot electron distribution in the nanostructure. The speed of switching is determined by the rate of redistribution of the inhomogeneous electron temperature and not just the rate of heat exchange between electrons and phonons. This effect depends on both the spatial overlap between control and signal fields in the metamaterial and hot-electron diffusion effects. Thus, switching rates can be controlled in nanostructured systems by designing geometrical parameters and selecting wavelengths, which determine the control and signal mode distributions.}}

abstract={A novel method for the synthesis of catalytically active composites based on gold clusters incorporated into an alumina matrix was proposed. The method combines sol--gel and supercritical fluid technologies. The composites were synthesized by precipitating of gold clusters and alumina sol mixture in the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) carbon dioxide medium. Gold clusters were synthesized in the colloidal solution of alumina sol in situ (one-pot synthesis) via controlled reduction of AuIII using PPh3 as a stabilizer for the first time. It was shown that this method allows us to stabilize gold clusters with sizes less than 2{\thinspace}nm in the alumina matrix with a developed specific surface area (SBET{\thinspace}={\thinspace}441{\thinspace}m2/g) and a narrow pore size distribution. The obtained composite does not contain stabilizer, which may poison the catalyst. The developed approach makes possible to synthesize catalytically active composites with a certain amount of gold cluster and oxide matrix of different nature.},

Here we report, using the powerful atomic-scale analysis technique known as atom probe tomography, the quantitative spatial distribution of individual aluminium atoms, including their three-dimensional extent of segregation. Using a nearest-neighbour statistical analysis, we precisely determine the short-range distribution of aluminium over the different T-sites and determine the most probable Al--Al neighbouring distance within parent and steamed ZSM-5 crystals, as well as assess the long-range redistribution of aluminium upon zeolite steaming.},

Nanoparticle structures depend on their size, chemical composition, ordering, as well as external conditions e.g. synthesis method, pressure, temperature, support. On top of that, at finite temperatures nanoparticles can fluctuate among different structures, opening new and exciting horizons for the design of optimal nanoparticles for advanced applications.

A diversity of plasmonic systems such as nanoparticles, resonators, and waveguides has been introduced to enhance hot-carrier generation; however, the impact of propagating surface plasmons on hot-carrier lifetime has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we systematically study the hot-carrier relaxation in thin film gold (Au) samples under surface plasmon coupling with the Kretschmann configuration. We observe that the locally confined electric field at the surface of the metal significantly affects the hot-carrier distribution and electron temperature, which results in a slowing of the hot electrons' relaxation time, regardless of the average value of the absorbed power in the Au thin film. This result could be extended to other plasmonic nanostructures, enabling the control of hot-carrier lifetimes throughout the optical frequency range.},

Prototypical processes of key industrial relevance are used as test examples: catalytic pollution control as three-way catalysts and NOx decomposition, the Fischer-Tropsch process, reforming of alkanes, electrocatalysis, and new energy resources as fuel cells and hydrogen storage.

abstract = {Nonequilibrium nanoalloys are metastable solids obtained at the nanoscale under nonequilibrium conditions that allow the study of kinetically frozen atoms and the discovery of new physical and chemical properties. However, the stabilization of metastable phases in the nanometric size regime is challenging and the synthetic route should be easy and sustainable, for the nonequilibrium nanoalloys to be practically available. Here we report on the one-step laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) of nonequilibrium Au\-Co alloy nanoparticles (NPs) and their characterization on ensembles and at the single nanoparticle level. The NPs are obtained as a polycrystalline solid solution stable in air and water, although surface cobalt atoms undergo oxidation to Co(II). Since gold is a renowned plasmonic material and metallic cobalt is ferromagnetic at room temperature, these properties are both found in the NPs. Besides, surface conjugation with thiolated molecules is possible and it was exploited to obtain colloidally stable solutions in water. Taking advantage of these features, an array of magnetic-plasmonic dots was obtained and used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering experiments. Overall, this study confirms that LASiS is an effective method for the formation of kinetically stable nonequilibrium nanoalloys and shows that Au\-Co alloy NPs are appealing magnetically responsive plasmonic building blocks for several nanotechnological applications.},

abstract = {We propose the Augmented Grouping Approach (AugGA) and its deployment in the Augmented Grouping GO (AugGGO) scheme, for an efficient exploration of the chemical ordering (or compositional structure) of multi-component (alloyed) nanoparticles. The approach is based on a 'grouping' strategy (previously proposed for high-symmetry structures) by which the number of compositional degrees of freedom of the system is decreased by defining sets of atoms (groups, or orbits, or shells) that are constrained to be populated by the same element. Three fundamental advances are here included with respect to previous proposals: (i) groups are defined on the basis of descriptors (no point-group symmetry is assumed), (ii) bulk groups can exploit general chemical ordering patterns taken from databases, and (iii) sub-grouping is realized via a multi-descriptor strategy (here using two basic descriptors: the atomic energy and a few types of geometry patterns). The AugGGO approach is applied to two prototypical examples of binary nanoalloys: Pd-Pt and Ag-Cu, with a size between ≈500 and ≈1300 atoms, in different configurations, and the convex hull of the mixing energy as a function of composition is derived. It is shown how the three advances here proposed decisively extend the power and scope of the grouping approach: (i) making it applicable to any generic structural framework, (ii) achieving a thorough sampling of the core regions of nanoparticles, and (iii) catching exotic/unexpected chemical ordering arrangements, at a computational cost which is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of traditional Monte Carlo single-exchange techniques.},

The structure of bimetallic nanoparticles can be oriented in random alloy, alloy with an intermetallic compound, cluster-in-cluster or core-shell structures and is strictly dependent on the relative strengths of metal-metal bond, surface energies of bulk elements, relative atomic sizes, preparation method and conditions, etc. In this review, selected properties, such as structure, optical, catalytic and photocatalytic of noble metals-based bimetallic nanoparticles, are discussed together with preparation routes.

abstract={The notion of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor research emerged more than eight decades ago from the first observed phenomena in 1902 until the first introduced principles for gas sensing and biosensing in 1983. The sensing platform has been hand-in-hand with the plethora of sensing technology advancement including nanostructuring, optical technology, fluidic technology, and light source technology, which contribute to substantial progress in SPR sensor evolution. Nevertheless, the commercial products of SPR sensors in the market still require high-cost investment, component, and operation, leading to unaffordability for their implementation in a low-cost point of care (PoC) or laboratories. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of SPR sensor development including the state of the art from a perspective of light source technology trends. Based on our review, the trend of SPR sensor configurations, as well as its methodology and optical designs are strongly influenced by the development of light source technology as a critical component. These simultaneously offer new underlying principles of SPR sensor towards miniaturization, portability, and disposability features. The low-cost solid-state light source technology, such as laser diode, light-emitting diode (LED), organic light emitting diode (OLED) and smartphone display have been reported as proof of concept for the future of low-cost SPR sensor platforms. Finally, this review provides a comprehensive overview, particularly for SPR sensor designers, including emerging engineers or experts in this field.}

This chapter reviews the experimental and simulation evidence for polytetrahedral order in small clusters, liquids, glasses, and periodic or quasiperiodic crystals and shows that it is a powerful unifying concept in their theoretical description. Discussions of polytetrahedral order have recently received new impetus from the experimental discovery of quasi crystal that have a macroscopic icosahedral symmetry and which, in many cases, are closely related to Frank–Kasper compounds. Coxeter introduced a mean field theory of dense-random packing called the “statistical honeycomb model” and emphasized the importance of “polytope {3, 3, 5},” a regular four-dimensional Platonic solid that provides a regular tetrahedral tiling of S3, the curved, three-dimensional surface of a sphere embedded in four dimensions. The 120 atoms of polytope {3 , 3 , 5} form a regular lattice where each atom sits in an identical icosahedral coordination shell and serves as a paradigm for the kind of global order prevented by frustration in flat space.}

FK phases are speculated to emerge as the minimal-distortional packings of space-filling spherical domains, but a precise measure of this distortion and how it affects assembly thermodynamics remains ambiguous. We use two complementary approaches to demonstrate that the principles driving FK lattice formation in diblock copolymers emerge directly from the strong-stretching theory of spherical domains, in which a minimal interblock area competes with a minimal stretching of space-filling chains. The relative stability of FK lattices is studied first using a diblock foam model with unconstrained particle volumes and shapes, which correctly predicts not only the equilibrium σ lattice but also the unequal volumes of the equilibrium domains. We then provide a molecular interpretation for these results via self-consistent field theory, illuminating how molecular stiffness increases the sensitivity of the intradomain chain configurations and the asymmetry of local domain packing. These findings shed light on the role of volume exchange on the formation of distinct FK phases in copolymers and suggest a paradigm for formation of FK phases in soft matter systems in which unequal domain volumes are selected by the thermodynamic competition between distinct measures of shape asymmetry.}}

abstract={Optical metasurfaces have become versatile platforms for manipulating the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light. A platform for achieving independent control over each of these properties, however, remains elusive due to the limited engineering space available when using a single-layer metasurface. For instance, multiwavelength metasurfaces suffer from performance limitations due to space filling constraints, while control over phase and amplitude can be achieved, but only for a single polarization. Here, we explore bilayer dielectric metasurfaces to expand the design space for metaoptics. The ability to independently control the geometry and function of each layer enables the development of multifunctional metaoptics in which two or more optical properties are independently designed. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate multiwavelength holograms, multiwavelength waveplates, and polarization-insensitive 3D holograms based on phase and amplitude masks. The proposed architecture opens a new avenue for designing complex flat optics with a wide variety of functionalities.}

The realization of nanoagents that can be removed from the body after use remains thus a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium gold-iron alloys behave as shape-morphing nanocrystals with the properties of self-degradable multifunctional nanomedicines. DFT calculations combined with mixing enthalpy-weighted alloying simulations predict that Au-Fe solid solutions can exhibit self-degradation in an aqueous environment if the Fe content exceeds a threshold that depends upon element topology in the nanocrystals. Exploiting a laserassisted synthesis route, we experimentally confirm that nonequilibrium Au-Fe nanoalloys have a 4D behavior, that is, the ability to change shape, size, and structure over time, becoming ultrasmall Au-rich nanocrystals. In vivo tests show the potential of these transformable Au-Fe nanoalloys as efficient multimodal contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and computed X-ray absorption tomography and further demonstrate their self-degradation over time, with a significant reduction of long-term accumulation in the body, when compared to benchmark gold or iron oxide contrast agents. Hence, Au-Fe alloy nanoparticles exhibiting 4D behavior can respond to the need for safe and degradable inorganic multifunctional nanomedicines required in clinical translation.},

abstract = {In metal nanoparticles the resonance wavelength of light-driven collective electron oscillations is determined by the particle shape. This shape dependence can be used for optical data storage by spectral coding. In this way the storage density can be increased by at least a factor of 5 compared with that for conventional optical storage principles.},

abstract = {The targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells faces a barrier because most chemotherapeutic agents are distributed throughout the body contributing to general toxicity and low tolerance by patients, and the therapy is then withdrawn. Metallic nanoparticles have been used for a wide range of applications in different medical areas. In the treatment of cancer, metallic nanoparticles appear as new carrier and contrast agents. Through active and passive targeting these metallic nanoparticles were used for tumor-cell imaging. Such nanoparticles have recently opened the way for site-specific targeting and drug delivery. In this chapter provide information about tumor cell growth, the benefits of modern over traditional cancer treatment methods, targeted delivery of anticancer agents utilizing nanoparticles, effects on performance and life expectancy of nanotechnologies and problems, as well as the results and future prospects for metallic nanoparticles as trials for cancer treatment. The development of metal nanoparticles is rapid and multidirectional, and the enhanced functional ability of metallic nanoparticles underlines its importance as a means to support alternative modalities of cancer therapy.}
