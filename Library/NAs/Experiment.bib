abstract  ="Hot carrier generation by light in various semiconductors and metallic nanostructures is important for many photocatalytic and photochemical processes{,} including water and hydrogen splitting. Here{,} we report on investigations of hot electron generation and extraction from Pt decorated SiO2–Au nanoparticles using the degradation of methylene blue dye as a test-bed. Enhanced catalytic activity was found with an increase of Pt loading on the surface of the heterostructures. The small size of the Au nanoparticles (∼12 nm) decorating the silica nanoparticles reduces hot electron collisions and related thermalization processes{,} since charge carriers have short paths to the surface where reactions take place and where Pt is situated. The heterostructures exhibit a broad plasmonic resonance in the visible wavelength range from 500 to 700 nm and hot carrier generation predominately takes place under resonant excitation. Electron-microscopy characterization and numerical modelling have allowed the optimization of Pt coverage for hot-electron transfer{,} consisting of a thin Pt shell covering the Au nanoparticle with Pt nanoparticles additionally placed on top. This geometry provides an increased number of active sites for methylene blue degradation and promotes separation of charge carriers generated by plasmonic excitations in Au. Such SiO2–Au–Pt nanoparticles are attractive for hot-electron production due to the tunability of their plasmonic resonance and enhanced catalytic activity."}

Microstructures of the brazed joints were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The mechanical properties of the brazed joints were measured by mechanical testing machine. The results show that the brazed joint mainly consist of TiC, Ti3SiC2, Ti5Si3, Ag, TiCu, Ti3Cu4 and Ti2Cu reaction products. TiC+Ti3SiC2/Ti5Si3+Ti2Cu reaction layers are formed near Cf/SiC composite side while Ti3Cu4/TiCu/Ti2Cu/Ti2Cu+Ti reaction layers are formed near TC4 side. The thickness of reaction layers of the brazed joint increases with the brazing temperature or holding time increasing. The maximum shear strengths of the brazed joints at room temperature and 500°C with brazing temperature 900°C and holding time 5min are 102 and 51MPa, respectively.}

Supported gold catalysts were originally identified as being active for this reaction twenty years ago, and since then, considerable advances have been made in the synthesis and characterisation of these catalysts. In this review, we identify and evaluate the progress towards solving the most important challenge in this research area: the development of robust, highly active catalysts that do not deactivate on-stream under realistic reaction conditions.},

abstract  ="Bimetallic copper–gold (Cu@Au) nanoparticles were synthesized and utilised to modify boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. Nanorod particles with a diameter size of around 10 nm and a length of around 20 nm were successfully synthesized. These nanoparticles were then attached to the BDD surface by using allylamine as the bridge. Comparison among the BDD modified with Cu@Au and individual gold nanoparticles showed that Cu@Au nanoparticles created around 3 times higher gold coverage on the BDD surface than normal gold nanoparticles. It was also found that the use of allylamine as the bridge can attach more gold than copper nanoparticles. Moreover{,} around two times higher current responses of oxygen reduction reaction were observed at Cu@Au-modified BDD. Good linearity in a concentration range from 2 to 9 ppm could be achieved with a sensitivity of 0.0138 mA ppm−1 and limit detection of 1.98 ppm. An application of the modified BDD for a biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) sensor using Rhodotorula mucilaginosa UICC Y-181 as the biosensing agent was also demonstrated with glucose solutions as the solution model. Sensitivity equivalent to 17.4 μA mM−1 BOD could be achieved. The system showed good stability with an RSD of 3.45\% in 10 measurements."}

Catalysts were activated by calcination at different temperatures in the range 573–873 K and characterized by HRTEM, XPS, and TPR. Among a series of catalysts with different Au/Cu ratio and metal loading, the Au1Cu3/TiO2 with 1.2 wt\% exhibited the best catalytic performance for epoxidation, both in terms of propene conversion rate and selectivity towards PO (0.25 mol POgM−1h−1 at 573 K). The highest TOF was obtained over a catalyst calcined at 673 K. At this calcination temperature, HRTEM revealed a large perimeter interface between the nanoparticles and the support, which was accompanied by an intense TPR hydrogen uptake at low temperature. At increasing calcination temperature, the surface of Au–Cu alloy nanoparticles was progressively decorated with oxidized Cu species, which were detrimental for epoxidation and favored allylic oxidation products. Isolation effects and control of the extent of Cu oxidation by Au in the alloy nanoparticles as well as the perimeter interface between Au–Cu alloy nanoparticles and TiO2 are imagined to play pivotal roles in the epoxidation of propene.}

The catalysts were prepared by deposition-precipitation method and characterized by XRD, TEM, HRTEM, ICP-AES, TPR, NH3-TPD and XPS analyses. Detail study on the Au–Cu/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalysts was performed to optimize Ti/Fe ratio, pH during preparation of the catalyst, calcination temperature and reaction temperature. The Au–Cu/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalyst with Ti/Fe=9/1 atomic ratio is more active and exhibits higher methanol conversion compared to the Au–Cu/TiO2 catalyst. The higher activity of Fe-containing catalyst was attributed to the ability to supply reactive oxygen, thereby stabilize active gold species (Auδ+) in the catalyst. Studies on the optimization of pH during preparation of the Au–Cu/TiO2–Fe2O3 catalyst and calcination temperature showed that the catalyst prepared at pH 7 and dried at 373K (uncalcined) exhibited higher activity. The catalytic performance at various reaction temperatures shows that both methanol conversion and hydrogen selectivity are increased with increasing the temperature. A small increase in CO selectivity was observed beyond 523K, which is due to the decomposition of methanol and reverse water gas shift at high temperatures.}

Partial densification and the resulting high porosity content of Al2O3 substrates sintered at low temperatures led to braze infiltration of Al2O3 pores in 20min contact but no penetration occurred in dense Al2O3 substrates sintered at high temperatures. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) examination of the joints showed that chemical reactions between Al2O3 and braze constituents formed a Ti-rich reaction layer at braze/Al2O3 interface regardless of the sintering conditions and degree of densification of the Al2O3. Some redistribution of the substrate and braze constituents across the joint interfaces was observed due to dissolution and interdiffusion. The Knoop microhardness of sintered alumina was consistent with the degree of Al2O3 densification achieved, and microhardness profiles across the joint regions displayed a minimum (∼70–160KHN) in the braze region and a maximum (1900–2012KHN) in the alumina region. The polished CVI C–SiC composites led to better quality Al2O3/C–SiC composite joints and greater segregation of Ti at the composite/braze interface than unpolished composite specimens.}

In the early stages of growth phase separation occurs by nucleation in melted islands and a eutectic of randomly oriented crystallites forms. In later stages of growth the phase separation takes place by spinodal decomposition. It results in a strain stabilized unique morphology corresponding to an intermediate stage of phase separation.}

abstract = {Upon nonequilibrium processing using vapor quenching or mechanical alloying, the supersaturated fcc solid solution predominates over the amorphous solution in the Ag–Cu system. The thermodynamic and kinetic origins of this phase selection are explored. The enthalpy of formation of both solutions has been determined as a function of composition using calorimetry measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The enthalpy of the fcc solution is found to be lower than that of the competing amorphous phase. The preference for the fcc crystalline state is enhanced by the low kinetic barrier to crystallization of the amorphous solution, which occurred during quenching even when high cooling rates were employed or during annealing at low temperatures. Consequently, the retention of an amorphous Ag–Cu solution required kinetic trapping using ultrahigh quenching rates achievable only under stringent vapor deposition conditions or in MD simulations. However, transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of local regions of amorphous Ag–Cu after cold rolling of multilayers of elemental Ag and Cu foils at room temperature. This result of partial amorphization demonstrates the possibility of mechanically driven solid-state amorphization in a system with a positive heat of mixing.}

The as-deposited NML is constituted of alternating nano-layers (thickness ≈ 10 nm) of a chemically inert AlN barrier and a eutectic Ag–Cu40at\% nano-alloy. The nano-alloy in the as-deposited state is composed of a fcc matrix of Ag nano-grains (≈6 nm){,} which are supersaturated by Cu{,} and some smaller embedded Cu rich nano-grains (≈4 nm). Heating up to 265 °C activates segregation of Cu out of the supersaturated Ag nano-grains phase{,} thus initiating phase separation. At T > 265 °C{,} the phase-separated Cu metal partially migrates to the top NML surface{,} thereby relaxing thermally-accumulated compressive stresses in the confined alloy nano-layers and facilitating grain coarsening of (still confined) phase-separated nano-crystallites. Further heating and annealing up to 420 °C results in complete phase separation{,} forming extended Ag and Cu domains with well-defined coherent Ag/AlN interfaces. The observed outflow of Cu well below the eutectic melting point of the bulk Ag–Cu alloy might provide new pathways for designing low-temperature nano-structured brazing materials."}

abstract={Since Haruta et al. discovered that small gold nanoparticles finely dispersed on certain metal oxide supports can exhibit surprisingly high activity in CO oxidation below room temperature, heterogeneous catalysis by supported gold nanoparticles has attracted tremendous attention. The majority of publications deal with the preparation and characterization of conventional gold catalysts (e.g., Au/TiO2), the use of gold catalysts in various catalytic reactions, as well as elucidation of the nature of the active sites and reaction mechanisms. In this overview, we highlight the development of novel supported gold catalysts from a materials perspective. Examples, mostly from those reported by our group, are given concerning the development of simple gold catalysts with single metal-support interfaces and heterostructured gold catalysts with complicated interfacial structures. Catalysts in the first category include active Au/SiO2 and Au/metal phosphate catalysts, and those in the second category include catalysts prepared by pre-modification of supports before loading gold, by post-modification of supported gold catalysts, or by simultaneous dispersion of gold and an inorganic component onto a support. CO oxidation has generally been employed as a probe reaction to screen the activities of these catalysts. These novel gold catalysts not only provide possibilities for applied ca
talysis, but also furnish grounds for fundamental research.},

abstract={Real-time monitoring of reaction processes is helpful for understanding the reaction mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the etching mechanism of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by iodine on a single-nanoparticle level because AuNPs have become important nanoprobes with applications in sensing and bioimaging fields owing to their specific localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties. By using a scattered-light dark-field microscopic imaging (iDFM) technique, the in situ KI/I2-treated etching processes of various shapes of AuNPs, including nanospheres (AuNSs), nanorods (AuNRs), and nanotrigonal prisms (AuNTs), were monitored in real time. It was found that the scattered light of the different shapes of AuNPs exhibited noticeable color changes upon exposure to the etching solution. The scattering spectra during the etching process showed obvious blue-shifts with decreasing scattered intensity owing to the oxidation of Au atoms into [AuI2]--. Both finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations and monitoring of morphological variations proved that the etching was a thermodynamic-dependent process through a chamfering mechanism coupled with layer-by-layer peeling, resulting in isotropic spheres with decreased particle sizes.},

abstract={To combine the advantages of ultrafast femtosecond nano-optics with an on-chip communication scheme, optical signals with a frequency of several hundreds of THz need to be down-converted to coherent electronic signals propagating on-chip. So far, this has not been achieved because of the overall slow response time of nanoscale electronic circuits. Here, we demonstrate that 14{\thinspace}fs optical pulses in the near-infrared can drive electronic on-chip circuits with a prospective bandwidth up to 10{\thinspace}THz. The corresponding electronic pulses propagate in macroscopic striplines on a millimeter scale. We exploit femtosecond photoswitches based on asymmetric, nanoscale metal junctions to drive the pulses. The non-linear ultrafast response is based on a plasmonically enhanced, multiphoton absorption resulting in a field emission of ballistic hot electrons propagating across the nanoscale junctions. Our results pave the way towards femtosecond electronics integrated in wafer-scale THz circuits.},

Here, the fundamentals of hot-electron generation, injection and regeneration are reviewed, with special attention paid to recent progress towards photovoltaic devices.

ABSTRACT = {In the present work, we provide evidence for visible light irradiation of the Au/TiO2 nanoparticles&rsquo; surface plasmon resonance band (SPR) leading to electron injection from the Au nanoparticles to the conduction band of TiO2. The Au/TiO2 SPR band is shown to greatly enhance the light absorption of TiO2 in the visible region. Evidence is presented for the light absorption by the Au/TiO2 plasmon bands leading to the dissolution of Au nanoparticles. This dissolution occurs concomitantly with the injection of the hot electrons generated by the Au plasmon into the conduction band of TiO2. The electron injection from the Au nanoparticles into TiO2 was followed by femtosecond spectroscopy. The formation of Au ions was further confirmed by the spectral shift of the transient absorption spectra of Au/TiO2. The spectral changes of the SPR band of Au/TiO2 nanoparticles induced by visible light were detected by spectrophotometer, and the morphological transformation of Au/TiO2 was revealed by electron microscopy techniques as well. Subsequently, the fate of the Au ions was sorted out during the growth and biofilm formation for some selected Gram-negative bacteria. This study compares the bactericidal mechanism of Au ions and Ag ions, which were found to be substantially different depending on the selected cell used as a probe.},

abstract = {Hot carrier dynamics in plasmonic nanorod metamaterials and its influence on the metamaterial's optical Kerr nonlinearity is studied. The electron temperature distribution induced by an optical pump in the metallic component of the plasmonic metamaterial leads to geometry-dependent variations of the optical response and its dynamics as observed in both the transmission and reflection properties of the metamaterial slab. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of a metamaterial's optical response can be controlled via modal engineering. Both the transient response relaxation time and magnitude of the nonlinearity are shown to depend on the modal-induced spatial profile of the electron temperature distribution and the hot-electron diffusion in nanorods. The nonlocal effects, depending on the excitation-induced losses in the metal, are shown to dictate the modal structure of the metamaterial slab and the associated dynamics of its nonlinear response. The opportunity of controlling the electron temperature profile induced in the plasmonic nanorods by changing the metamaterial's geometry and/or excitation conditions paves the way to achieve controllable dynamics of the nonlinear optical response for free-space as well as integrated nanophotonic applications involving nonequilibrium electrons.},

abstract={While free electrons in metals respond to ultrafast excitation with refractive index changes on femtosecond time scales, typical relaxation mechanisms occur over several picoseconds, governed by electron-phonon energy exchange rates. Here, we propose tailoring these intrinsic rates by engineering a non-uniform electron temperature distribution through nanostructuring, thus, introducing an additional electron temperature relaxation channel. We experimentally demonstrate a sub-300 fs switching time due to the wavelength dependence of the induced hot electron distribution in the nanostructure. The speed of switching is determined by the rate of redistribution of the inhomogeneous electron temperature and not just the rate of heat exchange between electrons and phonons. This effect depends on both the spatial overlap between control and signal fields in the metamaterial and hot-electron diffusion effects. Thus, switching rates can be controlled in nanostructured systems by designing geometrical parameters and selecting wavelengths, which determine the control and signal mode distributions.},

abstract  ="Enhanced local electric fields are created by nanoparticles when pumped at wavelengths corresponding to Localised Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) modes{,} leading to Metal Induced Fluorescence Enhancement (MIFE). This paper describes the fluorescent enhancement due to reproducible and tuneable Au nanostructures on glass substrates fabricated over large areas by colloidal lithography. Interparticle separation{,} particle resonance{,} and the fluorescent dye properties (quantum yield and emission/excitation wavelengths) are all important factors influencing the fluorescent enhancement. A maximum fluorescence enhancement of 69 times from near infra-red (NIR) dye Alexa Fluor® 790 was observed."}

journal={Journal of Sol-Gel Science and Technology},
year={2019},
volume={92},
number={3},
abstract={A novel method for the synthesis of catalytically active composites based on gold clusters incorporated into an alumina matrix was proposed. The method combines sol--gel and supercritical fluid technologies. The composites were synthesized by precipitating of gold clusters and alumina sol mixture in the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) carbon dioxide medium. Gold clusters were synthesized in the colloidal solution of alumina sol in situ (one-pot synthesis) via controlled reduction of AuIII using PPh3 as a stabilizer for the first time. It was shown that this method allows us to stabilize gold clusters with sizes less than 2{\thinspace}nm in the alumina matrix with a developed specific surface area (SBET{\thinspace}={\thinspace}441{\thinspace}m2/g) and a narrow pore size distribution. The obtained composite does not contain stabilizer, which may poison the catalyst. The developed approach makes possible to synthesize catalytically active composites with a certain amount of gold cluster and oxide matrix of different nature.},

abstract = {We report the first results on Au(110) layers obtained with MgO(110) substrates by the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. A thin Fe(211) seed layer is first deposited on the substrate. This allows the growth of a high-quality gold buffer layer having a 1 × 2 reconstructed surface. The half-order streaks measured by reflection high-energy diffraction (RHEED) are shifted, indicating a high density of steps. After annealing at 400 K, the surface becomes flat and RHEED oscillations during the growth are obtained at room temperature.}

abstract  ="Hot carriers generated by plasmonic excitations have recently opened up new avenues in photocatalysis. The transfer of these energetic carriers to adjacent molecules can promote chemical transformations that are important for hydrogen generation by water splitting{,} CO2 reduction and degradation of organic pollutants. Here{,} we have developed and optimised a plasmonic hot-carrier catalytic system based on silica nanoparticles decorated with plasmonic gold nanoparticles as a source of hot carriers{,} equipped with platinum nanoclusters as co-catalyst for the enhancement of hot-carrier extraction. The latter plays a triple role by providing: a surface favourable for molecular adsorption; hot-electron generation near the nanoclusters due to field enhancement effects and electron momentum relaxation facilitating the electron transfer across the metal surface{,} exactly where molecules are adsorbed. The combination of plasmonic and catalytic metals in nano-heterostructured devices provides a new platform for photocatalytic processes and is of significant interest for future solar-based clean technologies."}

	abstract = {The local structure of nanoparticles can be determined by a direct interpretation of the first peaks observed in the radial distribution function obtained from powder diffraction data measured to high Q values. Single peak fits to these maxima yield the mean distances and width of the distribution in the first few neighbouring shells. An algorithm is presented to calculate the radial distribution function based on the simulation of a single nanoparticle. This algorithm allows a flexible description of nanoparticle size and shape. Based on this algorithm the structure of CdS:glutathione nanoparticles of less than 2 nm diameter is presented. This structure consists of a CdS core with tetrahedrally coordinated first neighbours and a shell of glutathione molecules. Within the core several stacking faults lie in different orientations with a stacking fault probability of 40%.}

abstract={Zeolite catalysis is determined by a combination of pore architecture and Br{\o}nsted acidity. As Br{\o}nsted acid sites are formed by the substitution of AlO4 for SiO4 tetrahedra, it is of utmost importance to have information on the number as well as the location and neighbouring sites of framework aluminium. Unfortunately, such detailed information has not yet been obtained, mainly due to the lack of suitable characterization methods. Here we report, using the powerful atomic-scale analysis technique known as atom probe tomography, the quantitative spatial distribution of individual aluminium atoms, including their three-dimensional extent of segregation. Using a nearest-neighbour statistical analysis, we precisely determine the short-range distribution of aluminium over the different T-sites and determine the most probable Al--Al neighbouring distance within parent and steamed ZSM-5 crystals, as well as assess the long-range redistribution of aluminium upon zeolite steaming.},
