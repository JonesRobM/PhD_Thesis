abstract={This review summarizes the progress that has been made in the use of nanostructured SPR-based chemical sensors and biosensors. Following an introduction into the field, a first large section covers principles of nanomaterial-based SPR sensing, mainly on methods using noble metal nanoparticles (spheres, cubes, triangular plates, etc.). The next section covers methods for functionalization of plasmonic nanostructures, with subsections on functionalization using (a) amino acids and proteins; (b) oligonucleotides, (c) organic polymers, and (d) organic compounds. Several tables are presented that give an overview on the wealth of methods and materials published. A concluding section summarizes the current status, addresses current challenges, and gives an outlook on potential future trends. This review is not intended to be a comprehensive compilation of the literature in the field but rather is a systematic overview of the state of the art in surface chemistry of plasmonic nanostructures. The ability of various ligands and receptors for functionalization of nanoparticles as well as their sensing capability is discussed.},

abstract={Optical metasurfaces have become versatile platforms for manipulating the phase, amplitude, and polarization of light. A platform for achieving independent control over each of these properties, however, remains elusive due to the limited engineering space available when using a single-layer metasurface. For instance, multiwavelength metasurfaces suffer from performance limitations due to space filling constraints, while control over phase and amplitude can be achieved, but only for a single polarization. Here, we explore bilayer dielectric metasurfaces to expand the design space for metaoptics. The ability to independently control the geometry and function of each layer enables the development of multifunctional metaoptics in which two or more optical properties are independently designed. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate multiwavelength holograms, multiwavelength waveplates, and polarization-insensitive 3D holograms based on phase and amplitude masks. The proposed architecture opens a new avenue for designing complex flat optics with a wide variety of functionalities.},

@article{Amendola2020,
abstract = {Several examples of nanosized therapeutic and imaging agents have been proposed to date, yet for most of them there is a low chance of clinical translation due to longterm in vivo retention and toxicity risks. The realization of nanoagents that can be removed from the body after use remains thus a great challenge. Here, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium gold-iron alloys behave as shape-morphing nanocrystals with the properties of self-degradable multifunctional nanomedicines. DFT calculations combined with mixing enthalpy-weighted alloying simulations predict that Au-Fe solid solutions can exhibit self-degradation in an aqueous environment if the Fe content exceeds a threshold that depends upon element topology in the nanocrystals. Exploiting a laserassisted synthesis route, we experimentally confirm that nonequilibrium Au-Fe nanoalloys have a 4D behavior, that is, the ability to change shape, size, and structure over time, becoming ultrasmall Au-rich nanocrystals. In vivo tests show the potential of these transformable Au-Fe nanoalloys as efficient multimodal contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and computed X-ray absorption tomography and further demonstrate their self-degradation over time, with a significant reduction of long-term accumulation in the body, when compared to benchmark gold or iron oxide contrast agents. Hence, Au-Fe alloy nanoparticles exhibiting 4D behavior can respond to the need for safe and degradable inorganic multifunctional nanomedicines required in clinical translation.},

Nevertheless, as the device dimensions are scaled down, floating gate memory encounters various challenges: the increasing leakage current leading to a serious reliability issue and the decreasing of charge density. Hence, metal nanoparticle-based floating gate memory has been proposed and become a promising candidate for nonvolatile memories due to its outstanding operation speed, excellent scalability, and favorable reliability. This review briefly introduces the classification of memory devices. The operation mechanisms, fabrication and characterization of metal nanoparticle-based floating gate memory are discussed based on research activities reported in recent years.},

ABSTRACT={Nanoparticles (nanoparticles) have received much attention in biological application because of their unique physicochemical properties. The metal- and metal oxide–supported nanomaterials have shown significant therapeutic effect in medical science. The mechanisms related to the interaction of nanoparticles with animal and plant cells can be used to establish its significant role and to improve their activity in health and medical applications. Various attempts have been made to discuss the antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial activity of metal-supported nanoparticles. Despite all these developments, there is still a need to investigate their performance to overcome modern challenges. In this regard, the present review examines the role of various types of metal-supported nanomaterials in different areas such as antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and so on. Based on the significant ongoing research and applications, it is expected that metal-supported nanomaterials play an outstanding role not only in medical but also in other important areas.}

Metallic nanoparticles have been used for a wide range of applications in different medical areas. In the treatment of cancer, metallic nanoparticles appear as new carrier and contrast agents. Through active and passive targeting these metallic nanoparticles were used for tumor-cell imaging. Such nanoparticles have recently opened the way for site-specific targeting and drug delivery. In this chapter provide information about tumor cell growth, the benefits of modern over traditional cancer treatment methods, targeted delivery of anticancer agents utilizing nanoparticles, effects on performance and life expectancy of nanotechnologies and problems, as well as the results and future prospects for metallic nanoparticles as trials for cancer treatment. The development of metal nanoparticles is rapid and multidirectional, and the enhanced functional ability of metallic nanoparticles underlines its importance as a means to support alternative modalities of cancer therapy.}
