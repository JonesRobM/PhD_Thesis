	abstract = {At the nanoscale, the investigation of structural features becomes fundamental as we can establish relationships between cluster geometries and their physicochemical properties. The peculiarity lies in the variety of shapes often unusual and far from any geometrical and crystallographic intuition clusters can assume. In this respect, we should treat and consider nanoparticles as a new form of matter. Nanoparticle structures depend on their size, chemical composition, ordering, as well as external conditions e.g. synthesis method, pressure, temperature, support. On top of that, at finite temperatures nanoparticles can fluctuate among different structures, opening new and exciting horizons for the design of optimal nanoparticles for advanced applications. This article aims to overview geometrical features of transition metal clusters and of their various rearrangements.}

title = {Hot electron relaxation dynamics in semiconductors: assessing the strength of the electron–phonon coupling from the theoretical and experimental viewpoints},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {The rapid development of the computational methods based on density functional theory, on the one hand, and of time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved spectroscopy, on the other hand, allows today an unprecedently detailed insight into the processes governing hot-electron relaxation dynamics, and, in particular, into the role of the electron–phonon coupling. Instead of focusing on the development of a particular method, theoretical or experimental, this review aims to treat the progress in the understanding of the electron–phonon coupling which can be gained from both, on the basis of recently obtained results.

We start by defining several regimes of hot electron relaxation via electron–phonon coupling, with respect to the electron excitation energy. We distinguish between energy and momentum relaxation of hot electrons, and summarize, for several semiconductors of the IV and III–V groups, the orders of magnitude of different relaxation times in different regimes, on the basis of known experimental and numerical data. Momentum relaxation times of hot electrons become very short around 1 eV above the bottom of the conduction band, and such ultrafast relaxation mechanisms are measurable only in the most recent pump-probe experiments.

Then, we give an overview of the recent progress in the experimental techniques allowing to obtain detailed information on the hot-electron relaxation dynamics, with the main focus on time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved photoemission experiments. The particularities of the experimental approach developed by one of us, which allows to capture time-, energy-, and momentum-resolved hot-electron distributions, as well as to measure momentum relaxation times of the order of 10 fs, are discussed.

We further discuss the main advances in the calculation of the electron–phonon scattering times from first principles over the past ten years, in semiconducting materials. Ab initio techniques and efficient interpolation methods provide the possibility to calculate electron–phonon scattering times with high precision at reasonable numerical cost. We highlight the methods of analysis of the obtained numerical results, which allow to give insight into the details of the electron–phonon scattering mechanisms.

Finally, we discuss the concept of hot electron ensemble which has been proposed recently to describe the hot-electron relaxation dynamics in GaAs, the applicability of this concept to other materials, and its limitations. We also mention some open problems.}

abstract = {Surface plasmon mediated hot-carrier generation is utilized widely for the manipulation of electron--photon interactions in many types of optoelectronic devices including solar cells, photodiodes, and optical modulators. A diversity of plasmonic systems such as nanoparticles, resonators, and waveguides has been introduced to enhance hot-carrier generation; however, the impact of propagating surface plasmons on hot-carrier lifetime has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, we systematically study the hot-carrier relaxation in thin film gold (Au) samples under surface plasmon coupling with the Kretschmann configuration. We observe that the locally confined electric field at the surface of the metal significantly affects the hot-carrier distribution and electron temperature, which results in a slowing of the hot electrons' relaxation time, regardless of the average value of the absorbed power in the Au thin film. This result could be extended to other plasmonic nanostructures, enabling the control of hot-carrier lifetimes throughout the optical frequency range.},

abstract={The size increase of a nanoscale material is commonly associated with the increased stability of its ordered phases. Here we give a counterexample to this trend by considering the formation of the defect-free L11 ordered phase in AgPt nanoparticles, and showing that it is better stabilized in small nanoparticles (up to 2.5{\thinspace}nm) than in larger ones, in which the ordered phase breaks in multiple domains or is interrupted by faults. The driving force for the L11 phase formation in small nanoparticles is the segregation of a monolayer silver shell (an Ag-skin) which prevents the element with higher surface energy (Pt) from occupying surface sites. With increasing particle size, the Ag-skin causes internal stress in the L11 domains which cannot thus exceed the critical size of {\textasciitilde}2.5{\thinspace}nm. A multiscale modelling approach using full-DFT global optimization calculations and atomistic modelling is used to interpret the findings.},

@article{Guadagnini2021,
abstract = {Nonequilibrium nanoalloys are metastable solids obtained at the nanoscale under nonequilibrium conditions that allow the study of kinetically frozen atoms and the discovery of new physical and chemical properties. However, the stabilization of metastable phases in the nanometric size regime is challenging and the synthetic route should be easy and sustainable, for the nonequilibrium nanoalloys to be practically available. Here we report on the one-step laser ablation synthesis in solution (LASiS) of nonequilibrium Au−Co alloy nanoparticles (NPs) and their characterization on ensembles and at the single nanoparticle level. The NPs are obtained as a polycrystalline solid solution stable in air and water, although surface cobalt atoms undergo oxidation to Co(II). Since gold is a renowned plasmonic material and metallic cobalt is ferromagnetic at room temperature, these properties are both found in the NPs. Besides, surface conjugation with thiolated molecules is possible and it was exploited to obtain colloidally stable solutions in water. Taking advantage of these features, an array of magnetic-plasmonic dots was obtained and used for surface-enhanced Raman scattering experiments. Overall, this study confirms that LASiS is an effective method for the formation of kinetically stable nonequilibrium nanoalloys and shows that Au−Co alloy NPs are appealing magnetically responsive plasmonic building blocks for several nanotechnological applications.},

@article{Fioravanti2021,
abstract = {We propose the Augmented Grouping Approach (AugGA) and its deployment in the Augmented Grouping GO (AugGGO) scheme, for an efficient exploration of the chemical ordering (or compositional structure) of multi-component (alloyed) nanoparticles. The approach is based on a 'grouping' strategy (previously proposed for high-symmetry structures) by which the number of compositional degrees of freedom of the system is decreased by defining sets of atoms (groups, or orbits, or shells) that are constrained to be populated by the same element. Three fundamental advances are here included with respect to previous proposals: (i) groups are defined on the basis of descriptors (no point-group symmetry is assumed), (ii) bulk groups can exploit general chemical ordering patterns taken from databases, and (iii) sub-grouping is realized via a multi-descriptor strategy (here using two basic descriptors: the atomic energy and a few types of geometry patterns). The AugGGO approach is applied to two prototypical examples of binary nanoalloys: Pd-Pt and Ag-Cu, with a size between ≈500 and ≈1300 atoms, in different configurations, and the convex hull of the mixing energy as a function of composition is derived. It is shown how the three advances here proposed decisively extend the power and scope of the grouping approach: (i) making it applicable to any generic structural framework, (ii) achieving a thorough sampling of the core regions of nanoparticles, and (iii) catching exotic/unexpected chemical ordering arrangements, at a computational cost which is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of traditional Monte Carlo single-exchange techniques.},

Bimetallic nanoparticles could show not only the combination of the properties related to the presence of two individual metals, but also new properties due to a synergy between two metals. The structure of bimetallic nanoparticles can be oriented in random alloy, alloy with an intermetallic compound, cluster-in-cluster or core–shell structures and is strictly dependent on the relative strengths of metal-metal bond, surface energies of bulk elements, relative atomic sizes, preparation method and conditions, etc. In this review, selected properties, such as structure, optical, catalytic and photocatalytic of noble metals-based bimetallic nanoparticles, are discussed together with preparation routes. The effects of preparation method conditions as well as metal properties on the final structure of bimetallic nanoparticles (from alloy to core–shell structure) are followed. The role of bimetallic nanoparticles in heterogeneous catalysis and photocatalysis are discussed. Furthermore, structure and optical characteristics of bimetallic nanoparticles are described in relation to the some features of monometallic NPs. Such a complex approach allows to systematize knowledge and to identify the future direction of research.}
