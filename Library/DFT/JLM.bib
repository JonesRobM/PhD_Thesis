abstract = {The stabilized jellium model is used to explore the physics of self-compression for spherical clusters of simple-metal atoms. Within the continuum or liquid drop model, strong compression of the interior ionic density of a small cluster (with respect to the bulk density) results from cooperation between surface tension and surface suppression of the elastic stiffness. The latter effect is due to the large negative value of σ″, the second derivative of surface tension with respect to uniform strain. Self-compression also renormalizes the effective curvature-energy coefficient, and contributes to the asymptotic (large-radius) size effect on the ionization energy. A quantum-mechanical calculation of interior density as a function of electron number displays small shell-structure oscillations around the average behavior predicted by the liquid drop model. Numerical results are presented for clusters of Al, Na, and Cs. For compact 6-atom clusters of these metals, predicted bond lengths are smaller than their bulk values by 10\%, 6\%, and 4\%, respectively.}

Mass spectra of Si, Ge and Sn clusters were very similar each other, showing intensity drops aftern=4 and 6 (and alson=10 for Ge) for singly charged clusters.

abstract  ="The inclusion of relativistic effects always brings to the scientific community great and stimulating surprises. To consider the spin–orbit term{,} which accounts for the interaction between the spatial and spin coordinates{,} requires the use of double point groups of symmetry in order to solve the Dirac equation or the two component approximation to it{,} leading to total angular momenta (j) functions{,} atomic or molecular spinors{,} instead of pure orbital angular momenta (){,} atomic or molecular orbitals. Large and small components{,} derived from the Dirac treatment{,} depict wavefunctions corresponding to fermions{,} electrons{,} which are described for the first time for a superatom case. In addition{,} their behavior is revisited in order to clarify the effects of the inclusion of the spin–orbit coupling into the electronic structure calculations{,} which can be extended to other superatoms{,} clusters{,} molecules and atoms."}
