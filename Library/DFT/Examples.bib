We first observe significant differences in the extinction spectra employing a classical approach based on the Green's dyadic method. By means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory, we calculate the optical spectrum under a δ-kick simulation, and the results are compared with the ground-state energetic properties, such as the HOMO-LUMO gap. A red-shift of the optical spectrum is expected as the fullerenes inflate, with only ± 10\% change in the size as the fullerene breathing, a 0.8 eV shift in the first peak position could be observed in the gold nanoparticle. Ag has a smoother behaviour than Au and Cu. We have also found changes in the optical spectra can not be directly interpreted as a result of changes in the HOMO-LUMO gap.}

abstract = {Oxide materials (ZnO, TiO2) doped with noble metals were synthesized using the combustion technique. The results of the addition of {Ag}, {Au}, and {Pd} up to a concentration of 2 mol\% on the structural, optical, morphological and antimicrobial properties was considered. X-ray diffraction experiments revealed that the crystal structure of the host materials remained unaltered despite doping with noble metals. From the scanning electron microscopy results, it was evident that the doped nanoparticles aggregated in clusters of different sizes in the host matrix. The plasmonic effect was also observed in the absorbance spectra of the different doped materials. The obtained materials have shown promising antimicrobial features. All ZnO materials exhibited a high antimicrobial activity, with very low minimum inhibitory concentration values, against the planktonic growth of all tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. All doped materials exhibited very good anti-biofilm activity, the lowest minimal biofilm eradication concentration values being registered for ZnO doped with Au and Pd toward Escherichia coli and for ZnO doped with Ag against Candida albicans. These results indicate the potential that these materials have for antimicrobial applications in the fields of biomedicine and environmental protection.}

abstract  ="Doping metal nanoclusters with a second type of metal is a powerful method for tuning the physicochemical properties of nanoclusters at the atomic level and it also provides opportunities for a fundamental understanding of alloying rules as well as new applications. Herein{,} we have devised a new{,} one-phase strategy for achieving heavy Ag-doping in Au25(SR)18 nanoclusters. This strategy overcomes the light doping of silver by previous methods. X-ray crystallography together with ESI-MS determined the composition of the product to be [AgxAu25−x(SC6H11)18]− with x ∼ 21. Cryogenic optical spectroscopy (80–300 K) revealed fine features in optical absorption peaks. Interestingly{,} the heavy doping of silver does not significantly change the electron–phonon coupling strength and the surface phonon frequency. DFT simulations reproduced the experimentally observed trend of electronic structure evolution with Ag doping. We further investigated the electrocatalytic performance of such heavily Ag-doped nanoclusters for oxygen reduction in alkaline solutions. The mass activity of ligand-off [AgxAu25−x(SC6H11)18]− nanoclusters (217.4 A g−1metal) was determined to be higher than that of ligand-on nanoclusters (29.6 A g−1metal) at a potential of −0.3 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The rotating disk electrode (RDE) studies revealed the tunable kinetic features of the nanoclusters by ligand removal."}

The adsorption energies are positively correlated with the charge transfer between the water molecule and the substrate{,} and the charge-rebalance between the Pt and O atoms of β-PtO2 upon water adsorption. More interestingly{,} an exceptionally large redshift is observed in the OH stretching mode of the adsorbed water monomer{,} due to the very strong hydrogen bonding with the substrate.

abstract  ="The liquid water–Pt(111) interface is studied with constant temperature ab initio molecular dynamics to explore the importance of liquid water dynamics of catalytic reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction in PEM fuel cells. The structure and energetics of hydroxyls formed at the liquid water–Pt(111) interface are found to be significantly different from those of the hydroxyl formed on a bare Pt(111) surface and the hydroxyl formed on a Pt(111) surface with a static water layer. We identify 1/12 ML *OH{,} 5/12 ML *OH and 2/3 ML *OH as particularly stable hydroxyl coverages in highly dynamic liquid water environments{,} which – contrary to static water–hydroxyl models – contain adjacent uncovered Pt sites. Atomic surface oxygen is found to be unstable in the presence of liquid water{,} in contrast to static atomic level simulations. These results give an improved understanding of hydroxide and surface oxide formation from Pt(111) cyclic voltammetry and allow us to draw detailed connections between the electrostatic potential and the interface structure. The study of hydrogen adsorption at the liquid water–Pt(111) interface finds competitive adsorption between the adsorbed hydrogen atoms and water molecules. This does not adhere with experimental observations{,} and this indicates that the Pt(111) surface has to be negatively charged for a correct description of the liquid water–Pt(111) interface at potentials where hydrogen adsorption occurs."}

abstract  ="The determination of optimal chemical ordering in nanoalloys{,} i.e. of the most stable pattern in which atoms are arranged in bi- or multicomponent metallic clusters{,} is quite complex due to the enormous number of different possible configurations. This problem is very difficult to tackle by first-principle methods except for very small systems. On the other hand{,} the treatment at the atomistic potential level is complicated in many cases (such as AgAu) by charge transfer effects between atoms of different species in different coordination environments. Here an empirical atomistic model is developed to take into account such effects. The model is used to determine the optimal chemical ordering in AgAu nanoalloys. Charge transfer between atoms is taken into account by a modification of the charge equilibration method of Goddard and Rappé [J. Phys. Chem.{,} 1991{,} 95{,} 3358]{,} in which a coordination-dependent electronegativity and hardness are introduced. The model is applied to the determination of chemical ordering in AgAu nanoalloys. It is shown that the inclusion of charge transfer effects is important for improving the agreement of the atomistic model with density-functional calculations{,} leading to the determination of lower-energy chemical ordering patterns."}

abstract={Computational design can accelerate the discovery of new materials with tailored properties, but applying this approach to plasmonic nanoparticles with diameters larger than a few nanometers is challenging as atomistic first-principles calculations are not feasible for such systems. In this paper, we employ a recently developed material-specific approach that combines effective mass theory for electrons with a quasistatic description of the localized surface plasmon to identify promising bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles for hot-electron photocatalysis. Specifically, we calculate hot-carrier generation rates of 100 different core-shell nanoparticles and find that systems with an alkali-metal core and a transition-metal shell exhibit high figures of merit for water splitting and are stable in aqueous environments. Our analysis reveals that the high efficiency of these systems is related to their electronic structure, which features a two-dimensional electron gas in the shell. Our calculations further demonstrate that hot-carrier properties are highly tunable and depend sensitively on core and shell sizes. The design rules resulting from our work can guide experimental progress towards improved solar energy conversion devices.},

Lowest energy structures determined by density functional calculations are then studied by time-dependent density functional theory to calculate optical properties. The present study shows that for AgPt nanoparticles with core-shell structure the optical properties are sensitive to both Pt concentration and cluster size.

abstract = {With the growing potential applications of nanoparticles in biomedicine especially the increasing concerns of nanotoxicity of gold nanoparticles, the interaction between protein and nanoparticles is proving to be of fundamental interest for bio-functionalization of materials. The interaction of glycine (Gly) amino acid with Au 32 fullerene was first investigated with B3LYP-D3/TZVP model. Several forms of glycine were selected to better understand the trends in binding nature of glycine interacting with the nanocage. We have evaluated various stable configurations of the Gly/Au 32 complexes and the calculated adsorption energies and AIM analysis indicate that non-Gly, z-Gly and also tripeptide glycine can form stable bindings with Au 32 at aqueous solution via their amino nitrogen (N) and/or carbonyl/carboxyl oxygen (O) active sites. Furthermore, cysteine, tyrosine, histidine and phenylalanine amino acids bound also strongly to the Au 32 nanocage. Electronic structures and quantum molecular descriptors calculations also demonstrate the significant changes in the electronic properties of the nanocage due to the attachment of selected amino acids. DFT based MD simulation for the most stable complex demonstrate that Gly/Au 32 complex is quite stable at ambient condition. Our first-principles findings offer fundamental insights into the functionalization of Au 32 nanocage and envisage its applicability as novel carrier of the drugs.},

abstract = {We report a joint experimental and theoretical study of the electronic and atomic structures of small gold clusters with up to 14 atoms. Well-resolved photoelectron spectra were obtained for Au N-(N) 1-14) at several photon energies. Even-odd alternations were observed, where the even-sized clusters (except Au 10-) exhibit an energy gap between the lowest binding energy peak and the rest of the spectrum, indicating that all the neutral even-sized clusters have closed shells. The Au 10-spectrum reveals the existence of isomers, with the ground-state cluster exhibiting an extremely high electron binding energy. Evidence of multiple isomers was also observed in the spectra of N) 4, 8, 12, and 13. The structures of the gold cluster anions in the range N) 4-14 were investigated using first-principles simulations. A striking feature of the anionic clusters in this range is the occurrence of planar ground-state structures, which were predicted in earlier theoretical studies (H{\"{a}}kkinen, H.; et al. Phys. ReV. Lett. 2002, 89, 033401) and observed in ion-mobility experiments (Furche, F.; et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2002, 117, 6982) and the existence of close-lying isomers. The calculated electron detachment energies and density of states were compared with the measured data, which confirmed the ground-state structures of the anions. It is found that the main isomers observed experimentally indeed consist of planar clusters up to Au 12-, whereas for Au 13-and Au 14-the theoretical results from three-dimensional isomers agree better with the experiment, providing further support for the 2D to 3D structural transition at Au 12-, as concluded from previous ion mobility experiments. We also find that small neutral clusters exhibit a tendency to form two-dimensional structures up to a size of 13 atoms.},

Using relativistic density functional calculations, we found that Au 20 possesses a tetrahedral structure, which is a fragment of the face-centered cubic lattice of bulk gold with a small structural relaxation. Au 20 is thus a unique molecule with atomic packing similar to that of bulk gold but with very different properties.},

abstract  ="The energetics of 98 atom bimetallic Pd–Pt clusters are studied using a combination of: a genetic algorithm technique (to explore vast areas of the configurational space); a basin-hopping atom-exchange routine (to search for lowest-energy homotops at fixed composition); and a shell optimisation approach (to search for high symmetry isomers). The interatomic interactions between Pd and Pt are modelled by the Gupta many-body empirical potential. For most compositions{,} the putative global minima are found to have structures based on defective Marks decahedra{,} but in the composition range from Pd46Pt52 to Pd63Pt35{,} the Leary tetrahedron (LT)—a structure previously identified for 98 atom Lennard-Jones clusters—is consistently found as the most stable structure. Based on the excess energy stability criterion{,} Pd56Pt42 represents the most stable cluster across the entire composition range. This structure{,} a Td-symmetry LT{,} exhibits multi-layer segregation with an innermost core of Pd atoms{,} an intermediate layer of Pt atoms and an outermost Pd surface shell (Pd–Pt–Pd). The stability of the Leary tetrahedron is compared against other low-energy competing structural motifs: the Marks decahedron (Dh-M){,} a “quasi” tetrahedron (a closed-packed structure) and two other closed-packed structures. The stability of LT structures is rationalized in terms of their spherical shape and the large number of nearest neighbours."}

abstract={Electron migration in molecules is the progenitor of chemical reactions and biological functions after light-matter interaction. Following this ultrafast dynamics, however, has been an enduring endeavor. Here we demonstrate that, by using machine learning algorithm to analyze high-order harmonics generated by two-color laser pulses, we are able to retrieve the complex amplitudes and phases of harmonics of single fixed-in-space molecules. These complex dipoles enable us to construct movies of laser-driven electron migration after tunnel ionization of N2 and CO2 molecules at time steps of 50 attoseconds. Moreover, the angular dependence of the migration dynamics is fully resolved. By examining the movies, we observe that electron holes do not just migrate along the laser polarization direction, but may swirl around the atom centers. Our result establishes a general scheme for studying ultrafast electron dynamics in molecules, paving a way for further advance in tracing and controlling photochemical reactions by femtosecond lasers.},

abstract={The nature and extent of hydrogen bonding in water has been scrutinized for decades, including how it manifests in optical properties. Here we report vacuum ultraviolet absorption spectra for the lowest-lying electronic state of subcritical and supercritical water. For subcritical water, the spectrum redshifts considerably with increasing temperature, demonstrating the gradual breakdown of the hydrogen-bond network. Tuning the density at 381{\thinspace}{\textdegree}C gives insight into the extent of hydrogen bonding in supercritical water. The known gas-phase spectrum, including its vibronic structure, is duplicated in the low-density limit. With increasing density, the spectrum blueshifts and the vibronic structure is quenched as the water monomer becomes electronically perturbed. Fits to the supercritical water spectra demonstrate consistency with dimer/trimer fractions calculated from the water virial equation of state and equilibrium constants. Using the known water dimer interaction potential, we estimate the critical distance between molecules (ca. 4.5{\thinspace}{\AA}) needed to explain the vibronic structure quenching.},

We also derived an analytical model describing the microscopic mechanism of strong-field dynamics in presence of spin-orbit coupling, starting from a locally U(1){\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}SU(2) gauge-invariant Hamiltonian. Our results reveal that SOC: (i) affects the strong-field excitation of carriers to the conduction bands by modifying the bandstructure of Na3Bi, (ii) makes each spin channel reacts differently to the driven laser by modifying the electron velocity (iii) changes the emission timing of the emitted harmonics. Moreover, we show that the SOC affects the harmonic emission by directly coupling the charge current to the spin currents, paving the way to the high-harmonic spectroscopy of spin currents in solids.},
