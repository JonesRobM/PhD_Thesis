abstract={A promising trend in plasmonics involves shrinking the size of plasmon-supporting structures down to a few nanometers, thus enabling control over light-matter interaction at extreme-subwavelength scales. In this limit, quantum mechanical effects, such as nonlocal screening and size quantization, strongly affect the plasmonic response, rendering it substantially different from classical predictions. For very small clusters and molecules, collective plasmonic modes are hard to distinguish from other excitations such as single-electron transitions. Using rigorous quantum mechanical computational techniques for a wide variety of physical systems, we describe how an optical resonance of a nanostructure can be classified as either plasmonic or nonplasmonic. More precisely, we define a universal metric for such classification, the generalized plasmonicity index (GPI), which can be straightforwardly implemented in any computational electronic-structure method or classical electromagnetic approach to discriminate plasmons from single-particle excitations and photonic modes. Using the GPI, we investigate the plasmonicity of optical resonances in a wide range of systems including: the emergence of plasmonic behavior in small jellium spheres as the size and the number of electrons increase; atomic-scale metallic clusters as a function of the number of atoms; and nanostructured graphene as a function of size and doping down to the molecular plasmons in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Our study provides a rigorous foundation for the further development of ultrasmall nanostructures based on molecular plasmonics.},

We introduce a quality function that assesses the agreement of a pseudopotential calculation with all-electron FLAPW results, and the necessary plane-wave energy cutoff. This quality function allows us to use a Nelder–Mead optimization algorithm on a training set of materials to optimize the input parameters of the pseudopotential construction for most of the periodic table. We control the accuracy of the resulting pseudopotentials on a test set of materials independent of the training set. We find that the automatically constructed pseudopotentials (http://www.quantum-simulation.org) provide a good agreement with the all-electron results obtained using the FLEUR code with a plane-wave energy cutoff of approximately 60 Ry.}

abstract  ="PtSn {111} forms two ordered surface alloys namely p(2 × 2) and (√3 × √3R30°) and such bimetallic catalysts are often used in industrially catalysed reactions{,} such as hydrogenations{,} to improve performance although the reasons behind the improvements are generally not well understood. In this study density functional theory calculations have been performed for hydrogen adsorption at various sites on Pt {111} and the ordered PtSn {111} surfaces in order to characterise the differences between the pure and doped surfaces. The structural{,} bonding{,} electronic and vibrational characteristics of each system are presented indicating that there are no significant bonding differences when adsorption occurs at platinum sites on the surface. Where adsorption occurs at a tin site on the doped surface the adsorption energy is negative or the adsorption site changes to one involving only platinum atoms. Nudged elastic band calculations were used to determine the barrier to diffusion of the hydrogen atoms on the surface. The diffusion calculations show significant differences in the mobility of hydrogen providing a possible explanation for the changes in catalytic action on tin doping of platinum."}

Dissociative adsorption of H2 on Pt is significantly weakened in the aqueous phase compared to adsorption at gas–solid interfaces. Water destabilizes the adsorbed H atoms, decreasing the heat of adsorption by 19–22 kJ  while inducing an additional entropy loss of 50–70 J   K−1. Upon dissociative adsorption of H2, the average distance of water from the Pt surface increases and the liquid adopts a structure that is more ordered than before close to the Pt surface, which limits the translation mobility of the adsorbed H atoms. The presence of hydrated hydronium ions next to the Pt surface further lowers the H−Pt bond strength.},

	abstract = {In the last two decades, plasmon resonance in gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) has been the subject of intense research efforts. Plasmon physics is intriguing and its precise modelling proved to be challenging. In fact, plasmons are highly responsive to a multitude of factors, either intrinsic to the Au NPs or from the environment, and recently the need emerged for the correction of standard electromagnetic approaches with quantum effects. Applications related to plasmon absorption and scattering in Au NPs are impressively numerous, ranging from sensing to photothermal effects to cell imaging. Also, plasmon-enhanced phenomena are highly interesting for multiple purposes, including, for instance, Raman spectroscopy of nearby analytes, catalysis, or sunlight energy conversion. In addition, plasmon excitation is involved in a series of advanced physical processes such as non-linear optics, optical trapping, magneto-plasmonics, and optical activity. Here, we provide the general overview of the field and the background for appropriate modelling of the physical phenomena. Then, we report on the current state of the art and most recent applications of plasmon resonance in Au NPs.}

@book{Ullrich2012,
abstract = {Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a quantum mechanical framework which describes the dynamics of interacting electronic many-body systems formally exactly and in a computationally efficient manner. This book presents the concepts of TDDFT at the graduate level. An overview is given of the current state of the art of the field, with many applications in physics, (bio)chemistry, and materials science. The book begins with a self-contained review of ground-state density-functional theory, followed by four main parts. The first part presents the formal framework of TDDFT, beginning with the basic existence theorems of Runge, Gross, and van Leeuwen. The time-dependent Kohn-Sham scheme and the properties of the time-dependent exchange-correlation potential are then discussed in detail. The second part deals with the TDDFT formulation of linear-response theory, which can be used to calculate electronic excitation energies in principle exactly using the Casida equation. An overview is given of the performance of TDDFT for atomic and molecular excitation energies, with many examples. Special attention is paid to challenging cases such as double or charge-transfer excitations. The third part of the book focuses on further developments, including time-dependent current-density-functional theory, the optimized effective potential, and the connection to many-body theory. This part also deals with excitations in extended systems, such as plasmons and excitons. Several special TDDFT topics are discussed in part four: van der Waals interactions, nanoscale transport, strong-field phenomena, and coupled electron-nuclear motion and molecular dynamics. Additional resources are provided in several appendices.},

This quantity encompasses all non-trivial many-body effects of the ground-state and has to be approximated in any practical application of the theory. For the past 50 years, hundreds of such approximations have appeared, with many successfully persisting in the electronic structure community and literature. Here, we present a library that contains routines to evaluate many of these functionals (around 180) and their derivatives.

abstract = {The local density theory is developed by Hohenberg, Kohn and Sham is extended to the spin polarized case. A spin dependent one- electron potential pertinent to ground state properties is obtained from calculations of the total energy per electron made with a 'bubble' (or random phase) type of dielectric function. The potential is found to be well represented by an analytic expression corresponding to a shifted and rescaled spin dependent Slater potential. To test this potential the momentum dependent spin susceptibility of an electron gas is calculated. The results compare favourably with available information from other calculations and from experiment. The potential obtained in this paper should be useful for split band calculations of magnetic materials.}

abstract = {Abstract Photoinduced electron transfer (ET) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) are fundamental processes in natural phenomena, most noticeably in photosynthesis. Time-resolved spectroscopic evidence of coherent oscillatory behavior associated with these processes has been reported both in complex biological environments, as well as in biomimetic models for artificial photosynthesis. Here, we consider a few biomimetic models to investigate these processes in real-time simulations based on ab initio molecular dynamics and Ehrenfest dynamics. This allows for a detailed analysis on how photon-to-charge conversion is promoted by a coupling of the electronic excitation with specific vibrational modes and with proton displacements. The ET process shows a characteristic coherence that is linked to the nuclear motion at the interface between donor and acceptor. We also show real-time evidence of PCET in a benzimidazole–phenol redox relay.},
