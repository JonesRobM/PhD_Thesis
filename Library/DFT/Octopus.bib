abstract = {Abstract We report on the background, current status, and current lines of development of the octopus project. This program materializes the main equations of density-functional theory in the ground state, and of time-dependent density-functional theory for dynamical effects. The focus is nowadays placed on the optical (i.e. electronic) linear response properties of nanostructures and biomolecules, and on the non-linear response to high-intensity fields of finite systems, with particular attention to the coupled ionic-electronic motion (i.e. photo-chemical processes). In addition, we are currently extending the code to the treatment of periodic systems (both to one-dimensional chains, two-dimensional slabs, or fully periodic solids), magnetic properties (ground state properties and excitations), and to the field of quantum-mechanical transport or “molecular electronics.” In this communication, we concentrate on the development of the methodology: we review the essential numerical schemes used in the code, and report on the most recent implementations, with special attention to the introduction of adaptive coordinates, to the extension of our real-space technique to tackle periodic systems, and on large-scale parallelization. More information on the code, as well as the code itself, can be found at http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/. (© 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

abstract = {We present a computer package aimed at the simulation of the electron–ion dynamics of finite systems, both in one and three dimensions, under the influence of time-dependent electromagnetic fields. The electronic degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically within the time-dependent Kohn–Sham formalism, while the ions are handled classically. All quantities are expanded in a regular mesh in real space, and the simulations are performed in real time. Although not optimized for that purpose, the program is also able to obtain static properties like ground-state geometries, or static polarizabilities. The method employed proved quite reliable and general, and has been successfully used to calculate linear and non-linear absorption spectra, harmonic spectra, laser induced fragmentation, etc. of a variety of systems, from small clusters to medium sized quantum dots.}

abstract  ="Real-space grids are a powerful alternative for the simulation of electronic systems. One of the main advantages of the approach is the flexibility and simplicity of working directly in real space where the different fields are discretized on a grid{,} combined with competitive numerical performance and great potential for parallelization. These properties constitute a great advantage at the time of implementing and testing new physical models. Based on our experience with the Octopus code{,} in this article we discuss how the real-space approach has allowed for the recent development of new ideas for the simulation of electronic systems. Among these applications are approaches to calculate response properties{,} modeling of photoemission{,} optimal control of quantum systems{,} simulation of plasmonic systems{,} and the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation for low-dimensionality systems."}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Octopus is a general-purpose density-functional theory (DFT) code, with a particular emphasis on the time-dependent version of DFT (TDDFT). In this paper we present the ongoing efforts to achieve the parallelization of octopus. We focus on the real-time variant of TDDFT, where the time-dependent Kohn–Sham equations are directly propagated in time. This approach has great potential for execution in massively parallel systems such as modern supercomputers with thousands of processors and graphics processing units (GPUs). 

For harvesting the potential of conventional supercomputers, the main strategy is a multi-level parallelization scheme that combines the inherent scalability of real-time TDDFT with a real-space grid domain-partitioning approach. A scalable Poisson solver is critical for the efficiency of this scheme. For GPUs, we show how using blocks of Kohn–Sham states provides the required level of data parallelism and that this strategy is also applicable for code optimization on standard processors. Our results show that real-time TDDFT, as implemented in octopus, can be the method of choice for studying the excited states of large molecular systems in modern parallel architectures.}
