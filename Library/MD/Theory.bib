	abstract = {Interfaces, in which the atomic structures are greatly different from those in the bulk, play a crucial role in the material properties. Therefore, determination of a central structure that is involved with the interface properties is an important task in materials research. However, determination of the interface structure requires a huge number of calculations. We previously proposed a powerful machine learning technique based on virtual screening (VS) to determine interface structures (Kiyohara et al 2016 Sci. Adv. 2 e1600746). Here, we discuss the feasibility, versatility, and robustness of the prediction model for VS. Through this study, the prediction model constructed using only 5 types of grain boundaries determines the energies and structures of the 52 grain boundaries. Furthermore, based on the constructed prediction models, we investigated the geometrical differences between the grain boundaries of different rotation axes. We also investigated the structure-property relationship at the grain boundary (GB). We found that a short bond at the GB is the key factor for preferential vacancy formation at the GB.}

@article{Tribello2014,
abstract = {Enhancing sampling and analyzing simulations are central issues in molecular simulation. Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here - a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract  ="Energy calculations have been carried out on high symmetry icosahedral and cuboctahedral Cu–Au nanoalloy clusters of various compositions{,} with the interatomic interactions modelled by the Gupta many-body potential. For each composition{,} the lowest energy isomers (“homotops”) tend to have predominantly Au atoms on the surface and Cu atoms in the core{,} and this phenomenon is explained in terms of surface energy{,} atomic size and trends in cohesive energies. A number of order parameters and mixing energies have been introduced and it is shown that there is good correlation between the cluster binding energy and the average distance of the Au atoms from the centre of the cluster. Comparisons are made with previous theoretical calculations on Cu–Au clusters{,} as well as with experimental studies of the structures and atom ordering of deposited Cu–Au particles."}

@article{Giorgino2018,
abstract = {The proper choice of collective variables (CVs) is central to biased-sampling free energy reconstruction methods in molecular dynamics simulations. The PLUMED 2 library, for instance, provides several sophisticated CV choices, implemented in a C++ framework; however, developing new CVs is still time consuming due to the need to provide code for the analytical derivatives of all functions with respect to atomic coordinates. We present two solutions to this problem, namely (a) symbolic differentiation and code generation, and (b) automatic code differentiation, in both cases leveraging open-source libraries (SymPy and Stan Math, respectively). The two approaches are demonstrated and discussed in detail implementing a realistic example CV, the local radius of curvature of a polymer. Users may use the code as a template to streamline the implementation of their own CVs using high-level constructs and automatic gradient computation.

Solution method: The paper shows two approaches to automate the computation of CV gradients, namely, symbolic differentiation with code generation and automatic code differentiation, demonstrating their implementation entirely with open-source software (respectively, SymPy and the Stan Math Library).

The method, Common Neighbor Analysis, is a decomposition of the radial distribution function according to the local environment of the pairs of atoms and can provide direct interpretation of various features of the radial distribution function in terms of atomic structure. It can also be used to identify atoms in particular environment, such as FCC, HCP, BCC or icosahedral. We describe an application of this program to a study of crystal nucleation in a molten Cu slab. While the majority of atoms in the resulting crystals are classified as being FCC, stacking faults are observed and can be traced back to the near-critical nuclei. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Honeycutt1987,
abstract = {The properties of small clusters of Lennard-Jones atoms were studied by using molecular dynamics simulations. Clusters containing from 13 to 147 atoms were found to undergo a transition, analogous to a melting transition for bulk materials, from a low-energy solidlike structure at low temperatures to a set of higher energy liquidlike structures at high temperatures. The transition creates noticeable features in plots of the equilibrium energy of clusters as a function of temperature, but the shapes of the curves depend on the size of the cluster and on whether a canonical ensemble or microcanonical ensemble is used for calculating the properties. The nonequilibrium energy as a function of temperature on heating or cooling at a finite rate can differ significantly from the equilibrium results. Coexistence among the minimum-energy structure, high-energy liquidlike structures, and typically one or more intermediate structures was observed over a range of temperatures. Results from potential energy minimization of fcc and icosahedral structures of various sizes indicate that a Lennard-Jones cluster must contain at least 5000 atoms before the fcc structure becomes more stable than the structure of the Mackay icosahedra. {\textcopyright} 1987 American Chemical Society.},

Adsorbate vibrational excitations are selective to adsorbate/surface interactions and infrared (IR) spectra associated with activating adsorbate vibrational modes are accurate, capture details of most modes, and can be obtained operando. Current interpretation depends on heuristic peak assignments for simple spectra, precluding the possibility of obtaining detailed structural information. Here, we combine data-based approaches with chemistry-dependent problem formulation to develop physics-driven surrogate models that generate synthetic IR spectra from first-principles calculations. Using synthetic IR spectra of carbon monoxide on platinum, we implement multinomial regression via neural network ensembles to learn probability distributions functions (pdfs) that describe adsorption sites and quantify uncertainty. We use these pdfs to infer detailed surface microstructure from experimental spectra and extend this methodology to other systems as a first step towards characterizing complex interfaces and closing the materials gap.},

We use them to investigate the thermodynamic stability of gold nanoparticles of different sizes (1 to 6 nm), containing up to 6266 atoms, concerning a solid-liquid phase change through molecular dynamics simulations. We predict nanoparticle melting temperatures in good agreement with available experimental data. Furthermore, we characterize the solid-liquid phase change mechanism employing an unsupervised learning scheme to categorize local atomic environments.

abstract = {Computational science has seen in the last decades a spectacular rise in the scope, breadth, and depth of its efforts. Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great benefits could follow instead from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. We illustrate here our paradigm sustaining such vision, based around the four pillars of Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing. We then discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net), that has been tuned first to the demands of computational materials science. AiiDA's design is based on directed acyclic graphs to track the provenance of data and calculations, and ensure preservation and searchability. Remote computational resources are managed transparently, and automation is coupled with data storage to ensure reproducibility. Last, complex sequences of calculations can be encoded into scientific workflows. We believe that AiiDA's design and its sharing capabilities will encourage the creation of social ecosystems to disseminate codes, data, and scientific workflows.},

@misc{Ghiringhelli2017,
abstract = {With big-data driven materials research, the new paradigm of materials science, sharing and wide accessibility of data are becoming crucial aspects. Obviously, a prerequisite for data exchange and big-data analytics is standardization, which means using consistent and unique conventions for, e.g., units, zero base lines, and file formats. There are two main strategies to achieve this goal. One accepts the heterogeneous nature of the community, which comprises scientists from physics, chemistry, bio-physics, and materials science, by complying with the diverse ecosystem of computer codes and thus develops "converters" for the input and output files of all important codes. These converters then translate the data of each code into a standardized, code-independent format. The other strategy is to provide standardized open libraries that code developers can adopt for shaping their inputs, outputs, and restart files, directly into the same code-independent format. In this perspective paper, we present both strategies and argue that they can and should be regarded as complementary, if not even synergetic. The represented appropriate format and conventions were agreed upon by two teams, the Electronic Structure Library (ESL) of the European Center for Atomic and Molecular Computations (CECAM) and the NOvel MAterials Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory, a European Centre of Excellence (CoE). A key element of this work is the definition of hierarchical metadata describing state-of-the-art electronic-structure calculations.},
