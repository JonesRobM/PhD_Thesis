abstract  ="The energetics of 98 atom bimetallic Pd–Pt clusters are studied using a combination of: a genetic algorithm technique (to explore vast areas of the configurational space); a basin-hopping atom-exchange routine (to search for lowest-energy homotops at fixed composition); and a shell optimisation approach (to search for high symmetry isomers). The interatomic interactions between Pd and Pt are modelled by the Gupta many-body empirical potential. For most compositions{,} the putative global minima are found to have structures based on defective Marks decahedra{,} but in the composition range from Pd46Pt52 to Pd63Pt35{,} the Leary tetrahedron (LT)—a structure previously identified for 98 atom Lennard-Jones clusters—is consistently found as the most stable structure. Based on the excess energy stability criterion{,} Pd56Pt42 represents the most stable cluster across the entire composition range. This structure{,} a Td-symmetry LT{,} exhibits multi-layer segregation with an innermost core of Pd atoms{,} an intermediate layer of Pt atoms and an outermost Pd surface shell (Pd–Pt–Pd). The stability of the Leary tetrahedron is compared against other low-energy competing structural motifs: the Marks decahedron (Dh-M){,} a “quasi” tetrahedron (a closed-packed structure) and two other closed-packed structures. The stability of LT structures is rationalized in terms of their spherical shape and the large number of nearest neighbours."}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {Two basic alternative atomistic simulation methods (molecular dynamics and Monte-Carlo) have been used to reproduce the dealloying phenomenon in Cu-Pt nanoalloys. Using the Gupta (tight-binding) potential, we simulated nanoparticles consisting initially of 1500 Cu and 1500 Pt atoms. The involved programs propose search and following removing Cu atoms with the lowest specific binding energies. We have found that as a result of dealloying the particle surface layer is really enriched with Pt atoms. However the particle core keeps in general the structure of the initial nanoalloy. This effect is especially noticeable in molecular dynamics simulation. We have also established that dealloying results in formation of a defected particle structure (vacancies, first of all). Presumably, just such an effect yields the porous structure of bigger Cu-Pt particles in laboratory experiments on dealloying.}
