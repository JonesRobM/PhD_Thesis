abstract  ="We consider finite-size and temperature effects on the structure of model AuN clusters (30 ≤ N ≤ 147) bound by the Gupta potential. Equilibrium behaviour is examined in the harmonic superposition approximation{,} and the size-dependent melting temperature is also bracketed using molecular dynamics simulations. We identify structural transitions between distinctly different morphologies{,} characterised by various defect features. Reentrant behaviour and trends with respect to cluster size and temperature are discussed in detail. For N = 55{,} 85{,} and 147 we visualise the topography of the underlying potential energy landscape using disconnectivity graphs{,} colour-coded by the cluster morphology; and we use discrete path sampling to characterise the rearrangement mechanisms between competing structures separated by high energy barriers (up to 1 eV). The fastest transition pathways generally involve metastable states with multiple fivefold disclinations and/or a high degree of amorphisation{,} indicative of melting. For N = 55 we find that reoptimising low-lying minima using density functional theory (DFT) alters their energetic ordering and produces a new putative global minimum at the DFT level; however{,} the equilibrium structure predicted by the Gupta potential at room temperature is consistent with previous experiments."}

As a general trend, we recover a predominance of Rh@Au core-shell ordering over other chemical configurations. We identify new structural motifs with enhanced thermal stabilities. The physical features of those selected systems were studied at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) level, revealing profound correlations between the nanoalloys morphology and properties. Surprisingly, the arrangement of the inner Rh core seems to play a dominant role on nanoclusters’ physical features like the HOMO-LUMO gap and magnetic moment. Strong charge separations are recovered within the nanoalloys suggesting the existence of charge-transfer transitions.}

The atomic interactions are described by analytic embedded atom method. A Li-shell and Cu-core nanoparticle with fivefold symmetry is observed for the Li-Cu nanoalloys at different compositions. For all compositions considered, no intermixing is observed between the Cu-core and the Li-shell. Considering that the Li composition is smaller than 60\%, the Li-Pb nanoalloys exhibit a B2 intermetallic compound structure with weak surface segregation. When the Li composition continues to increase, the nanoalloy shape progressively transforms into icosahedral configuration and exhibits an L12 structure. The calculated excess energy indicates that the 175-atom rhombohedron at the Li composition of 50\% is more stable than the 147-atom icosahedron because a perfect B2 atomic arrangement is obtained in the former.}

abstract={The size increase of a nanoscale material is commonly associated with the increased stability of its ordered phases. Here we give a counterexample to this trend by considering the formation of the defect-free L11 ordered phase in AgPt nanoparticles, and showing that it is better stabilized in small nanoparticles (up to 2.5{\thinspace}nm) than in larger ones, in which the ordered phase breaks in multiple domains or is interrupted by faults. The driving force for the L11 phase formation in small nanoparticles is the segregation of a monolayer silver shell (an Ag-skin) which prevents the element with higher surface energy (Pt) from occupying surface sites. With increasing particle size, the Ag-skin causes internal stress in the L11 domains which cannot thus exceed the critical size of {\textasciitilde}2.5{\thinspace}nm. A multiscale modelling approach using full-DFT global optimization calculations and atomistic modelling is used to interpret the findings.},

abstract  = {Coalescence is a phenomenon in which two or more nanoparticles merge to form a single larger aggregate. By means of gas-phase magnetron-sputtering aggregation experiments on Pt–Pd nanoalloys{,} it is shown that the degree of coalescence can be tuned from a growth regime in which coalescence is negligible to a regime where the growth outcome is dominated by coalescence events. This transition is achieved by varying both the length of the aggregation zone and the pressure difference between the aggregation and the deposition chamber. In the coalescence-dominated regime{,} a wide variety of coalescing aggregates is produced and analyzed by TEM. The experimental results are interpreted with the aid of molecular-dynamics simulations. This allows to distinguish four different steps through which coalescence proceeds towards equilibrium. These steps{,} occurring on a hierarchy of well-separated time scales{,} consist in: (i) alignment of atomic columns; (ii) alignment of close-packed atomic planes; (iii) equilibration of shape; (iv) equilibration of chemical ordering."}}

The estimate of the temperature at which metallic nanoparticles become liquid is, however, a challenge and a standard definition is still missing. We discover a universal feature in the distribution of the atomic-pair distances that distinguishes the melting transition of monometallic nanoparticles. We analyse the solid-liquid change of several late-transition metals nanoparticles, i.e. Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, Au and Pt, through classical molecular dynamics. We consider various initial shapes from 146 to 976 atoms, corresponding to the 1.5-4.1 nm size range, placing the nanoparticles in either a vacuum or embedded in a homogeneous environment, simulated by an implicit force-field. Regardless of the material, its initial shape, size and environment, the second peak in the pair-distance distribution function, expected at the bulk lattice distance, disappears when the nanoparticle melts. As the pair-distance distribution is a measurable quantity, the proposed criterion holds for both numerical and experimental investigations. For a more straightforward calculus of the melting temperature, we demonstrate that the cross-entropy between a reference solid pair-distance distribution function and the one of nanoparticles at increasing temperatures present a quasi-first order transition at the phase-change temperature.

abstract = {Single-atom catalysts (SACs) minimize noble metal utilization and can alter the activity and selectivity of supported metal nanoparticles. However, the morphology of active centers, including single atoms and subnanometer clusters of a few atoms, remains elusive due to experimental challenges. The computational cost to describe numerous cluster shapes and sizes makes direct first-principles calculations impractical. We present a computational framework to enable structure determination for single-atom and subnanometer cluster catalysts. As a case study, we obtained the low-energy structures of Pdn (n = 1-21) clusters supported on CeO2(111), which are critical components of automobile three-way catalysts. Trained on density functional theory data, a three-dimensional cluster expansion is established using statistical learning to describe the Hamiltonian and predict energies of supported Pdn clusters of any structure. Low-energy stable and metastable structures are identified using a Metropolis Monte Carlo-based genetic algorithm in the canonical ensemble at 300 K. We observe that supported single atoms sinter to form bilayer clusters, and large cluster isomers share similarities in both shape and energy. The findings elucidate the significance of the support and microstructure on cluster stability. We discovered a simple surrogate structure-energy model, where the energy per atom scales with the square root of the average first coordination number, which can be used to estimate energies and compare the stability of clusters. Our framework, applicable to any metal/support system, fills an important methodological gap to predict the stability of supported metal catalysts in the subnanometer regime.},

abstract  ="The rapid development of applications relying on magnetism at the nanoscale has put a spotlight on nanoparticles with novel morphologies that are associated with enhanced electronic and magnetic properties. In this quest{,} nanoalloys combining highly magnetic cobalt and weakly reactive gold could offer many application-specific advantages{,} such as strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study{,} we have employed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide a systematic overview of the size- and morphology-dependence of the energetic order and magnetic properties of AuCo nanoparticles up to 2.5 nm in diameter. The core–shell icosahedron was captured as the most favourable morphology{,} showing a small preference over the core–shell decahedron. However{,} the magnetic properties (total magnetic moments and magnetic anisotropy) were found to be significantly improved within the L10 ordered structures{,} even in comparison to monometallic Co nanoparticles. Atom-resolved charges and orbital moments accessed through the DFT analysis of the electronic level properties permitted insight into the close interrelation between the AuCo nanoparticle morphology and their magnetism. These results are expected to assist in the design of tailored magnetic AuCo nanoalloys for specific applications."}

abstract  ="The energetics of 98 atom bimetallic Pd–Pt clusters are studied using a combination of: a genetic algorithm technique (to explore vast areas of the configurational space); a basin-hopping atom-exchange routine (to search for lowest-energy homotops at fixed composition); and a shell optimisation approach (to search for high symmetry isomers). The interatomic interactions between Pd and Pt are modelled by the Gupta many-body empirical potential. For most compositions{,} the putative global minima are found to have structures based on defective Marks decahedra{,} but in the composition range from Pd46Pt52 to Pd63Pt35{,} the Leary tetrahedron (LT)—a structure previously identified for 98 atom Lennard-Jones clusters—is consistently found as the most stable structure. Based on the excess energy stability criterion{,} Pd56Pt42 represents the most stable cluster across the entire composition range. This structure{,} a Td-symmetry LT{,} exhibits multi-layer segregation with an innermost core of Pd atoms{,} an intermediate layer of Pt atoms and an outermost Pd surface shell (Pd–Pt–Pd). The stability of the Leary tetrahedron is compared against other low-energy competing structural motifs: the Marks decahedron (Dh-M){,} a “quasi” tetrahedron (a closed-packed structure) and two other closed-packed structures. The stability of LT structures is rationalized in terms of their spherical shape and the large number of nearest neighbours."}
