abstract = {The ability to determine the atomic arrangement in nanoalloy catalysts and reveal the detailed structural features responsible for the catalytically active sites is essential for understanding the correlation between the atomic structure and catalytic properties, enabling the preparation of efficient nanoalloy catalysts by design. Herein we describe a study of CO oxidation over PdCu nanoalloy catalysts focusing on gaining insights into the correlation between the atomic structures and catalytic activity of nanoalloys. PdCu nanoalloys of different bimetallic compositions are synthesized as a model system and are activated by a controlled thermochemical treatment for assessing their catalytic activity. The results show that the catalytic synergy of Pd and Cu species evolves with both the bimetallic nanoalloy composition and temperature of the thermochemical treatment reaching a maximum at a Pd : Cu ratio close to 50 : 50. The nanoalloys are characterized structurally by ex situ and in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction, including atomic pair distribution function analysis. The structural data show that, depending on the bimetallic composition and treatment temperature, PdCu nanoalloys adopt two different structure types. One features a chemically ordered, body centered cubic (B2) type alloy consisting of two interpenetrating simple cubic lattices, each occupied with Pd or Cu species alone, and the other structure type features a chemically disordered, face-centered cubic (fcc) type of alloy wherein Pd and Cu species are intermixed at random. The catalytic activity for CO oxidation is strongly influenced by the structural features. In particular, it is revealed that the prevalence of chemical disorder in nanoalloys with a Pd : Cu ratio close to 50 : 50 makes them superior catalysts for CO oxidation in comparison with the same nanoalloys of other bimetallic compositions. However, the catalytic synergy can be diminished if the Pd50Cu50 nanoalloys undergo phase segregation into distinct chemically-ordered (B2-type) and disordered (fcc-type) domains. This finding is significant since it provides a rational basis for streamlining the design and preparation of Pd-based nanoalloy catalysts in terms of atomic structure and phase state.},

abstract = {Noble metals alloyed with certain transition metals in the form of a nanoalloy exhibit enhanced catalytic or electrocatalytic activities for various reactions, especially when oxygen activation is involved in the reactions. Recent studies have gained important insights into how the interatomic distances and structures of the nanoalloy catalysts operate synergistically in activating oxygen and maneuvering surface oxygenated species. This article highlights some of these insights into nanoalloy catalysts in which Pt is alloyed with a second and/or third transition metal (M/M′ = Co, Fe, V, Ni, Ir, etc.), for catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide in the gas phase and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cell reaction conditions. One important emphasis is placed on understanding of atomic-scale chemical/structural ordering and coordination in correlation with the catalytic or electrocatalytic properties based on findings from ex and in situ synchrotron X-ray techniques such as high energy X-ray diffraction coupled to atomic pair distribution function and X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopic analysis. The understanding of the details of active sites of the nanoalloys has significant implications for the design of low-cost, active, and durable catalysts for sustainable energy production and conversion reactions.
