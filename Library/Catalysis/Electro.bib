abstract = {Abstract Platinum is a prominent catalyst for a multiplicity of reactions because of its high activity and stability. As Pt nanoparticles are normally used to maximize catalyst utilization and to minimize catalyst loading, it is important to rationalize and predict catalytic activity trends in nanoparticles in simple terms, while being able to compare these trends with those of extended surfaces. The trends in the adsorption energies of small oxygen- and hydrogen-containing adsorbates on Pt nanoparticles of various sizes and on extended surfaces were analyzed through DFT calculations by making use of the generalized coordination numbers of the surface sites. This simple and predictive descriptor links the geometric arrangement of a surface to its adsorption properties. It generates linear adsorption-energy trends, captures finite-size effects, and provides more accurate descriptions than d-band centers and usual coordination numbers. Unlike electronic-structure descriptors, which require knowledge of the densities of states, it is calculated manually. Finally, it was shown that an approximate equivalence exists between generalized coordination numbers and d-band centers.},

abstract = {Predicting the optimal structure for a catalytic material has been a long-standing goal, but typically an arbitrary active site on a uniform surface is modelled. Identification of the most-active facet structure for structure-sensitive chemistries, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, is lacking. Here we develop an approach to predict the optimal structure of a catalytic material by identifying the active site and identifying the density and spatial arrangement of such sites while minimizing the surface energy. We find that the theoretical peak performance predicted by linear scaling relations is unattainable because of the lack of suitable active sites on low-index planes, as well as geometric and stability constraints. A random array of vacancies results in a modest performance enhancement compared to ideal facets, whereas defect sites with a maximum density in disordered structures significantly increase the catalyst performance. We applied this methodology to the oxygen reduction reaction on defected Pt(111), Pt(100), Au(111) and Au(100) surfaces.},

The kinetic simulations reveal clear differences between extended surfaces and nanoparticles in the size range of 1-5 nm. The presence of different types of sites on nanoparticles results in a turnover frequency that is orders of magnitude larger than on extended surfaces. For nanoparticles, the reaction conditions determine which sites dominate the overall activity. At low pressures and high temperatures, edge and corner sites determine the catalytic activity, whereas facet sites dominate the activity at high pressures and low temperatures.

To propose new defected catalytic surfaces, there is a need to systematically search through a combinatorial number of possible atom arrangements. Mathematical optimization is well suited to search this design space with algorithms that provide guarantees of optimality that are not possible with sampling algorithms. In this work, we develop several formulations for catalytic activity and stability as part of mathematical optimization models for designing nanostructured surfaces. Using the oxygen reduction reaction as an example, we show how optimization-based design can be used to efficiently explore the trade-off of activity against stability of surfaces. We furthermore demonstrate how nanostructuring can be applied to increase the expected activity of surfaces under various constraints on the coverage and overbinding of adsorbates. Our approach can be generally applied to other chemistries of interest and is suitably parameterized such that a wide array of systems can be considered, enabling evaluation of the sensitivity of different systems to constraints on the design space.},

Using molecular dynamics, we model formation pathways characteristic of physical synthesis routes as the annealing of a liquid droplet, the growth proceeding via the addition of single atoms, and the coalescence of individual nanoparticles. Each formation process leads to different and characteristic size-dependent distributions of their adsorption sites, catalogued and monitored on-the-fly by means of a suitable geometrical descriptor. Annealed or coalesced nanoparticles present a rather homogeneous distribution in the kind and relative abundance of non-equivalent adsorption sites. Atom-by-atom grown nanoparticles, instead, exhibit a more marked occurrence of adsorption sites corresponding to adatoms and small islands on (111) and (100) facets. Regardless of the formation process, highly coordinated sites are more likely in larger nanoparticles, while the abundance of low-coordination sites depends on the formation process and on the nanoparticle size. Furthermore, we show how each characteristic distribution of adsorption sites reflects in different size trends for the Cu-nanoparticle activity, taking as an example the electro-reduction of CO2 into CH4. To this end, we employ a multi-scale method and observe that the faceted but highly defected structures obtained during the atom-by-atom growth become more and more active with increasing size, with a mild dependence on the original seed. In contrast, the activity of Cu-nanoparticles obtained by annealing decreases with their size, while coalesced nanoparticles' activity shows a non-monotonic behaviour. This journal is},

abstract = {Peptide driven metallic nanomaterials fabrication under mild conditions has become a significant research thrust recently, thanks to its capability to generate multifunctional materials with tunable electronic and catalytic properties. Herein, peptide Z1 is employed to fabricate a series of AuPt alloyed nanoparticles with different Au-to-Pt ratios. The morphology is examined by electron microscopic techniques, and well-defined peanut-shape is observed for Au33Pt67 while spherical particles are obtained for the other samples. The AuPt alloys demonstrate effective electrocatalytic activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Au33Pt67 exhibits the best bifunctional electrocatalytic performance. Its ORR activity is superior than commercial Pt/C in alkaline media, verified by the positive onset potential (+1.02 V vs. RHE) and large diffusion-limited current density, while its HER activity is comparable with Pt/C, evidenced by the small overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (−171 mV vs. RHE) and low Tafel slope. Moreover, Au33Pt67 exhibits markedly higher long-term durability than Pt/C for both ORR and HER. The excellent activity and stability for ORR and HER are ascribed to Au alloying Pt induced synergistic effects. The results highlight the advantages of using peptide to fabricate bi-functional or multiple functional electrocatalysts with desirable activity and robust stability.}
