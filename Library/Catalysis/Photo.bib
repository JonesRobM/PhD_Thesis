abstract  ="The intrinsic correlation between an enhancement of catalytic activity and the flow of hot electrons generated at metal–oxide interfaces suggests an intriguing way to control catalytic reactions and is a significant subject in heterogeneous catalysis. Here{,} we show surface plasmon-induced catalytic enhancement by the peculiar nanocatalyst design of hexoctahedral (HOH) Au nanocrystals (NCs) with Cu2O clusters. We found that this inverse catalyst comprising a reactive oxide for the catalytic portion and a metal as the source of electrons by localized surface plasmon resonance (localized SPR) exhibits a change in catalytic activity by direct hot electron transfer or plasmon-induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) when exposed to light. We prepared two types of inverse catalysts{,} Cu2O at the vertex sites of HOH Au NCs (Cu2O/Au vertex site) and a HOH Au NC–Cu2O core–shell structure (HOH Au@Cu2O){,} to test the structural effect on surface plasmons. Under broadband light illumination{,} the Cu2O/Au vertex site catalyst showed 30–90$\%$ higher catalytic activity and the HOH Au@Cu2O catalyst showed 10–30$\%$ higher catalytic activity than when in the dark. Embedding thin SiO2 layers between the HOH Au NCs and the Cu2O verified that the dominant mechanism for the catalytic enhancement is direct hot electron transfer from the HOH Au to the Cu2O. Finite-difference time domain calculations show that a much stronger electric field was formed on the vertex sites after growing the Cu2O on the HOH Au NCs. These results imply that the catalytic activity is enhanced when hot electrons{,} created from photon absorption on the HOH Au metal and amplified by the presence of surface plasmons{,} are transferred to the reactive Cu2O."}

abstract  ="Plasmonic metal nanoparticles can concentrate optical energy and enhance chemical reactions on their surfaces. Plasmons can interact with adsorbate orbitals and decay by directly exciting a carrier from the metal to the adsorbate in a process termed the direct-transfer process. Although this process could be useful for enhancing the efficiency of a chemical reaction{,} it remains poorly understood. Here{,} we report a preliminary investigation employing time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) calculations to capture this process at a model metal–adsorbate interface formed by a silver nanoparticle (Ag147) and a carbon monoxide molecule (CO). Direct hot-electron transfer is observed to occur from the occupied states of Ag to the unoccupied molecular orbitals of CO. We determine the probability of this process and show that it depends on the adsorption site of CO. Our results are expected to aid the design of more efficient metal–molecule interfaces for plasmonic catalysis."}

abstract={The use of surface plasmons, charge density oscillations of conduction electrons of metallic nanostructures, to boost the efficiency of light-harvesting devices through increased light-matter interactions could drastically alter how sunlight is converted into electricity or fuels. These excitations can decay directly into energetic electron--hole pairs, useful for photocurrent generation or photocatalysis. However, the mechanisms behind plasmonic carrier generation remain poorly understood. Here we use nanowire-based hot-carrier devices on a wide-bandgap semiconductor to show that plasmonic carrier generation is proportional to internal field-intensity enhancement and occurs independently of bulk absorption. We also show that plasmon-induced hot electrons have higher energies than carriers generated by direct excitation and that reducing the barrier height allows for the collection of carriers from plasmons and direct photoexcitation. Our results provide a route to increasing the efficiency of plasmonic hot-carrier devices, which could lead to more efficient devices for converting sunlight into usable energy.},

abstract = {Summary
Photo-thermal reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide into methane, methanol, and carbon monoxide under mild conditions over suitable (photo)catalysts is a feasible pathway for the production of fuels and platform chemicals with minimal involvement of fossil fuels. In this perspective, we showcase transition metal nanoparticles (Ni, Cu, and Ru) dispersed over oxide semiconductors and their ability to act as photo catalysts in reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), methane dry reforming, methanol synthesis, and Sabatier reactions. By using a combination of light and thermal energy for activation, reactions can be sustained at much lower temperatures compared to thermally driven reactions and light can be used to leverage reaction selectivity between methanol, methane, and CO. In addition to influencing the reaction mechanism and decreasing the apparent activation energies, accelerating reaction rates and boosting selectivity beyond thermodynamic limitations is possible. We also provide future directions for research to advance the current state of the art in photo-thermal CO2 conversion.}
